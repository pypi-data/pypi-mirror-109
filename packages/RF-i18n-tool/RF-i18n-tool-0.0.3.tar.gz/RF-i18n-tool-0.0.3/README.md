# Internationalization Testing (i18n)
Library for Robot Framework automated web testing which support internationalization.

Introduction
--------------
In the past, the test object of one acceptance test script based on Robot Framework was often limited to web page in one language. However, nowadays a web page may have multiple language versions for people live in different countries. Therefore, tester often need to write more repetitive test scripts, and the cost of testing will also increase.

So this library can allow a same test script run on different languages' websites.

By the way, this is the 2nd version of i18n. If you want see the 1st version,
