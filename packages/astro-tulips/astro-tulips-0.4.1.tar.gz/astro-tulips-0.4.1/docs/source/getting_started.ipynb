    "# Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will explain the basics that are needed to get started with `tulips`. `tulips` creates visualizations of stellar evolution based on output from the [MESA](http://mesa.sourceforge.net/) stellar evolution code. To read MESA output files, `tulips` uses the [mesaPlot](https://github.com/rjfarmer/mesaplot) package. Here we will show you how to load a MESA model and how you can explore its properties. We will use jupyter notebooks to show the tutorials. With this application you can edit and run python code via a web browser. Have a look [here](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) for information on how to download and use it. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Loading a MESA model \n",
    "To show the functionalities of the `mesaPlot` output, we use a pre-computed MESA stellar model of an $11  M_{\\odot}$ star. In order to explore the properties of this model, we can create a `mesaPlot` object called `m11`, in which all the information about the stellar model will be stored. \n",
    "MESA produces two types of output files:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `history.data` files that contain the evolution of one-dimensional properties of the stellar model, such as its radius.\n",
    "* `profile.data` files that contain a snapshot of the interior stellar structure at a particular moment in time. For example, this file can contain the temperature as a function of the radius/mass coordinate\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, we show how to load the output of a MESA history file with `mesaPlot`, after which we can access its properties. "

For demonstration, we will plot one of these diagrams: the perceived color diagram. This can be done using just one command, passing our MESA object `m11` to the `perceived_color` function from `tulips`. It will show us the perceived color and size of the star at a single point in time, specified by the time index `time_ind`. For now, we only want to plot at `time_ind = 0`. "

    "`time_ind` refers to an index that follows every model stored in a MESA `history.data` file. This means the first model is at index 0 and the last is at index -1. It depends on your model which age this corresponds to. The powerful thing about `time_ind` is that it lets you find out some specific times very easily through numpy functions. For example, if you want to create a model of a star at the point when it finishes hydrogen burning, you can look for the model where the central hydrogen mass fraction is very small, like `end_hburn_index = np.where(m11.hist.center_h1 < 1e-4)[0][0]`. \n",

The function docstring can be found by typing `tulips.perceived_color()` and press `Shift` + `Tab` inside the parenthesis. The animation is saved as .mp4 file in a directory, which you can specify with `output_fname`. You can then call the `Video` function with the specified name.
