    "# Property profile diagram\n",
    "In this notebook we demonstrate how to create a property profile diagram. The diagram can be used when we want to explore a certain property throughout the stellar interior, such as the density, at a given moment in time. It will show us the profile of that property of the star and helps to visualize how the property changes from the center to the surface of the stellar object. The property profile diagram is customizable and offers many options that we will demonstrate in this notebook. To generate these diagrams, `tulips` divides the star into rings and computes the physical property at the location of each ring. Each ring is assigned a color that represents the value of the property at this location within the star. In the following example we will show how to create a property diagram that represents the density of a $11  M_{\\odot}$ star. \n",

    "Let's try to plot the density of this stellar model in the diagram. To do this, we call the `tulips.property_profile` function, which requires our MESA object `m11` as the first argument. With the `raxis` keyword, we can specify what the radius of the circle represents. In this example the radius of the circle represents the mass of the star, but sometimes it might be useful to represent other quantities instead, such as the radius of the star. `property_name` indicates which physical property we want to show in the diagram, which in this case will be logarithm of the density. With `time_ind` we specify a time index. Here, we plot the first model. The time index is further explained in the [Getting Started](getting_started.ipynb) page."

    "The property diagram shows us a stellar model represented by a circle that is divided in `num_rings` layers. If `num_rings` is -1 (default), it shows the maximum amount of rings, but this will computationally be more heavy. Each layer has its own color, corresponding to a certain density, as indicated by the colorbar on the right. You can hide the colorbar with `show_colorbar=False` and you can specify a label with `cbar_label`. Here, we see that the density decreases when you move outward. With the `cmin` and `cmax` argument you can specify what range of values of the property you want to show. In this example, we showed log densities densities in the range of $10^{-2}$ to 1 $[\\mathrm{g}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}]$. By default, `cmin` and `cmax` correspond to the mininum and maximum value of that property in the complete `profile.data` file of the stellar object.  "
