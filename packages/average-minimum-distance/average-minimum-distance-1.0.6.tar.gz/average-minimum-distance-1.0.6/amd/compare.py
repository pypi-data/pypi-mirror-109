    ----------
    pdd : ndarray
        A :math:`m_a` by k PDD matrix (with weights in the first column).
    pdd_ : ndarray
        A :math:`m_b` by k PDD matrix (with weights in the first column).

    -------

        Earth mover's distance between PDDs, where rows of the PDDs are
        compared with the metric.

    """
    For batch or single comparisons of AMDs for a single k.
    Computes distance between each pair of the two collections of inputs, 
    essentially wrapping scipy's cdist.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    reference : ndarray or list of ndarrays
        An :math:`m_a` by n array (of :math:`m_a` vectors/AMDs). 
        Can also be a list of vectors or a single vector.
    comparison : ndarray or list of ndarrays
        An :math:`m_b` by n array (of :math:`m_b` vectors/AMDs). 
        Can also be a list of vectors or a single vector.
    k : int, optional
        Only compare vectors/AMDs up to the k-th element.
    metric : str or callable, optional
        Usually AMDs are compared with the Chebyshev/l-infinity distance.
        Can take any metric + kwargs accepted by scipy.spatial.distance.cdist.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        A :math:`m_a` by :math:`m_b` distance matrix.
        The :math:`ij` th entry is the distance between reference[i]
        and comparison[j] given by the metric.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        Thrown if reference and comparison do not have the same number of
