-   \[Short description of non-trivial change.\]

0.7.0 (2021-06-11)
------------------

**Features and Improvements**
-   Update the subject in emails to include the log level instead of
    a generic message containing `Failure`
-   Update the email template for Teams to include the *border-color* for the log message
-   Add `COLOR_MAP` variable to map the `logging` log levels to color codes
-   Add screenshots, in the `docs/images` directory

0.6.0 (2021-06-10)
------------------

**Features and Improvements**
-   Add Bulk Logger implementations
-   Add integration and performance tests for the Bulk Loggers

**Bugfixes**

-   The decorator classes should now work when decorating instance methods
-   Minor code refactoring to ensure the library works for Python 3.7

0.5.3 (2021-06-08)
------------------

**Features and Improvements**
-   Default region used for the Lambda and Task logger classes was 'us-east-1'; updated to
    instead use the `AWS_REGION` environment variable which is available for AWS Lambda functions.
    This should now be applied to the defaults for Lambda and Task contexts, as well as the
    region in which to call the SES service (defaults to 'us-east-1' if not provided)

0.5.2 (2021-06-07)
------------------

**Bugfixes**
-   Fix up docs based on personal testing

0.5.0 (2021-06-07)
------------------

**Features and Improvements**
-   Log messages from this library should now be hidden by default, thanks to
    the `logging.NullHandler`
-   Library logs should also use the original (un-decorated) `logging` methods,
    to ensure that logs are only sent to CloudWatch, provided logging is properly configured.
    This ensures that messages logged by this library are never sent to MS Teams or Outlook.
-   Add test cases to confirm the above functionality
-   Add helper function `original_logger` to return the original (un-decorated) Logger
    object.

**Bugfixes**
-   Fix logging usage for the library to replace any unintentional `print` statements
    with the proper `logging` calls
-   The `_BaseLogger._get_account_name` method should not require an argument anymore

0.4.0 (2021-06-07)
------------------

**Features and Improvements**
-   Log messages that contain an `exc_info` parameter should
    now be sent to both Teams and any subscribed Dev emails.
    The messages also be properly formatted with the exception
    traceback info (thanks to the `logging` module)

**Important Notes**
-   The SES template `send-to-teams` has been updated;
    it's recommended that users update the SES template via a
    `upload_templates` call.

0.3.0 (2021-06-03)
------------------

**Features and Improvements**
-   Add a global function `set_account_name` which can be used to set the AWS account name, 
    which will eliminate the need of an IAM call to retrieve the account alias.

0.2.0 (2021-06-03)
------------------

**Features**
-   Allow the local timezone to be configured via the `LOCAL_TZ` environment variable

**Bugfixes**
-   The class decorators should now correctly work both when called with and w/o parentheses
