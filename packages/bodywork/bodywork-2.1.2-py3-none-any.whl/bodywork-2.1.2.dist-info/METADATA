Bodywork deploys machine learning projects developed in Python, to Kubernetes. It helps you to:

* serve models as microservices
* execute batch jobs
* run reproducible pipelines

On demand, or on a schedule. It automates repetitive DevOps tasks and frees machine learning engineers to focus on what they do best - solving data problems with machine learning.

## Get Started

Bodywork is distributed as a Python package - install it from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/bodywork/#description):

<div align="center">
<img src="https://bodywork-media.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/get_started_1.png"/>
</div>

Add a [bodywork.yaml](https://bodywork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/#configuring-a-project-for-deployment-with-bodywork) file to your Python project’s Git repo. The contents of this file describe how your project will be deployed:

</div>

Bodywork is used from the command-line to deploy projects to Kubernetes clusters. With a single command, you can start Bodywork containers (hosted by us on Docker Hub), that pull Python modules directly from your project’s Git repo, and run them:

</div>

You don’t need to build Docker images or understand how to configure Kuberentes resources. Bodywork will fill the gap between executable Python modules and operational jobs and services on Kubernetes.

If you’re new to Kubernetes then check out our guide to [Kubernetes for ML](https://bodywork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kubernetes/#getting-started-with-kubernetes) - we’ll have you up-and-running with a test cluster on your laptop, in under 10 minutes.

## Documentation

The documentation for bodywork-core can be found [here](https://bodywork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This is the best place to start.

## Deployment Templates

To accelerate your project's journey to production, we provide [deployment templates](https://bodywork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/template_projects/) for common use-cases:

* [batch scoring data](https://github.com/bodywork-ml/bodywork-batch-job-project)
* [deploying a model-scoring microservice with REST API](https://github.com/bodywork-ml/bodywork-serve-model-project)
* [scheduling a train-and-serve pipeline](https://github.com/bodywork-ml/bodywork-ml-pipeline-project)
