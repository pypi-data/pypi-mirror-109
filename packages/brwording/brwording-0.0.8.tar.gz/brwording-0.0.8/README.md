## How to use

`sintax`:
```python
from brwording import brwording

w = brwording.wording()

w.load_file('data/example.txt',type='txt')
w.build_tf_idf(lemmatizer=True,stopwords=True)

w.tfidf

```

The fields to `load_file` are:
1. `file`: the file path 
2. `type`: file type, can be `txt csv` or `excel`
3. `header`: if you are reading a csv file, so you must tell if this file has a header or not (`False` or `True`)
8. `sep`: if you are reading a csv file, you must tell what kind field separator you want
8. `column`: if you read a `csv` or `excel`file, you must tell what column you want to parse

The method `build_tf_idf` has a default `True`option for both parameters.

You can print the same information as a table using the follow command:

```python

w.sentimental_table()

```

if you want to create a wordcloud, just strike the folowing command, but if you want to create a cloud with your own mask, just pass you image address as `picture`

`sintax`:
```python
w.word_cloud(picture='none')

```

w.look2word('bonito')

```
