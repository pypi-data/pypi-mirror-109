# cdk-fargate-patterns

CDK patterns for serverless container with AWS Fargate

# `DualAlbFargateService`

`DualAlbFargateService` allows you to create one or many fargate services with both internet-facing ALB and internal ALB associated with all services. With this pattern, fargate services will be allowed to intercommunicat via internal ALB while external inbound traffic will be spread across the same service tasks through internet-facing ALB.

The sample below will create 3 fargate services associated with both external and internal ALBs. The internal ALB will have an alias(`internal.svc.local`) auto-configured from Route 53 so services can communite through the private ALB endpoint.

By enabling the `spot` property, you will provision spot-only fargate tasks to help you save up to 70%. Check more details about [Fargate Spot](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/12/aws-launches-fargate-spot-save-up-to-70-for-fault-tolerant-applications/?nc1=h_ls).

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
DualAlbFargateService(stack, "Service",
    spot=True, # FARGATE_SPOT only cluster
    tasks=[{
        "listener_port": 80,
        "task": order_task,
        "desired_count": 2,
        # customize the service autoscaling policy
        "scaling_policy": {
            "max_capacity": 20,
            "request_per_target": 1000,
            "target_cpu_utilization": 50
        }
    }, {"listener_port": 8080, "task": customer_task, "desired_count": 2}, {"listener_port": 9090, "task": product_task, "desired_count": 2}
    ],
    route53_ops={
        "zone_name": zone_name, # svc.local
        "external_alb_record_name": external_alb_record_name, # external.svc.local
        "internal_alb_record_name": internal_alb_record_name
    }
)
```

## Sample Application

This repository comes with a sample applicaiton with 3 services in Golang. On deployment, the `Order` service will be exposed externally on external ALB port `80` and all requests to the `Order` service will trigger sub-requests internally to another other two services(`product` and `customer`) through the internal ALB and eventually aggregate the response back to the client.

## Deploy

To deploy the sample application in you default VPC:

```sh
// compile the ts to js
$ yarn build
$ npx cdk --app lib/integ.default.js -c use_default_vpc=1 diff
$ npx cdk --app lib/integ.default.js -c use_default_vpc=1 deploy
```

On deployment complete, you will see the external ALB endpoint in the CDK output. `cURL` the external HTTP endpoint and you should be able to see the aggregated response.

```sh
$ curl http://demo-Servi-EH1OINYDWDU9-1397122594.ap-northeast-1.elb.amazonaws.com

{"service":"order", "version":"1.0"}
{"service":"product","version":"1.0"}
{"service":"customer","version":"1.0"}
```
