# GENERAL
def agents_number(n_jobs):
    '''
    This function computes the number of available agents based on
    the number of jobs provided.

    Parameters
    ---------
    n_jobs : int
        Number of threads for parallelization.

    Returns
    -------
    agents : int
        Number of threads that the computer can really provide.
