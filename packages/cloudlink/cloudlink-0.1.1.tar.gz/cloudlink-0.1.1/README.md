### CloudLink

CloudLink is a high-speed, reliable, and custom websocket extension for Scratch 3.0, with server code that runs on Python.
It permits cross-project (as well as cross-program) cloud variables.
It also enables full-duplex networking and limitless possibilities for Scratch 3.0 projects.

Example usage:
```
from cloudlink import CloudLink

cl = CloudLink()
cl.host(3000) # Hosts CloudLink in Server Mode on ws://localhost:3000/
```
