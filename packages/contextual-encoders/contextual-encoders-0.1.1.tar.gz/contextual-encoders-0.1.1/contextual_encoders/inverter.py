"""
Inverter
====================================
An *Inverter* is used to calculate a dissimilarity value given a similarity value and vice versa.
It can be seen as a one-to-one mapping :math:`\\mathcal{I} : [0,1] \\rightarrow [0,1]`.


Currently, the following *Inverters* are implement:

=========== ===========
Name        Formula
----------- -----------
lin         :math:`\\mathcal{I} (s) = 1 - s`
sqrt        :math:`\\mathcal{I} (s) = \\sqrt{1 - s}`
exp         :math:`\\mathcal{I} (s) = 2 - e^{ln(2) \\cdot s}`
cos         :math:`\\mathcal{I} (s) = cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\cdot s)`
=========== ===========

.. note::

    If a custom inverter is implemented, make sure that the function is invertible and
    the definition range and value range is :math:`[0, 1]`.
