"""
Context
====================================
The *Context* is the core part of the Contextual Encoders library.
It is used to measure the similarity or dissimilarity of attributes.
So far, two different Context-Types are implemented: *GraphContext* and *TreeContext*.
However, it is very likely that custom context needs to be implemented.
Therefore, the base classes *Context* and *GraphBasedContext* are used,
that come with optimized in- and export functions as well as caching.
