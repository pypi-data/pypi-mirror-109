Gatherer
====================================
A *Gatherer* is used to combine the form comparison values to an attribute comparison value.
I.e. when an attribute of a feature contains multiple values (forms of an attribute),
the *Gatherer* will combine the pairwise form comparison values to a single attribute comparison value.

Let :math:`x, y \\in F` be two features from the feature space :math:`F`.
Each feature consists of :math:`k` attributes and each attribute can have up to :math:`l` forms.
A form of an attribute of the feature :math:`x` can then be denoted as :math:`x_{a,i}`,
with :math:`a` being the attribute and :math:`i` being the form.
For simplicity, we just denote it as :math:`\\tilde{x}_i` and skip the attribute index.
A *Measure* is then defined as :math:`\\mathcal{M} : (\\tilde{x}_i, \\tilde{y}_j) \\rightarrow [0,1]`, i.e.
it maps a similarity or dissimilarity value to each attribute form.

The *Gatherer* uses the *Measure* together with all the attribute forms and calculates a single attribute
comparison value. Hence, it can be seen as a
mapping :math:`\\mathcal{G} : (x, y, \\mathcal{M}) \\mapsto g \\in \\mathbb{R}`.


Currently, the following *Gatherers* are implement:

=========== ===========
Name        Formula
----------- -----------
id          :math:`\\mathcal{G} (x, y, \\mathcal{M}) = \\mathcal{M}(x, y)`
first       :math:`\\mathcal{G} (x, y, \\mathcal{M}) = \\mathcal{M}(x_1, y_1)`
smm         :math:`\\mathcal{G} (x, y, \\mathcal{M}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\Big( \\frac{1}{|x|} \\sum_{i=1}^{l_x} \\mathcal{M}(x_i, \\tilde{y}) + \\frac{1}{|y|} \\sum_{i=1}^{l_y} \\mathcal{M}(\\tilde{x}, y_i) \\Big)`
=========== ===========

.. note::

    If a *Measure* has the property ``multiple_values``,
    it accepts all forms of an attribute as input and can calculate an attribute comparison value,
    rather then an attribute form comparison value.

    In this case, a *Gatherer* is not needed.
