"""
Reducer
====================================
A *Reducer* transforms a similarity or dissimilarity matrix into a set of vectors.
Mathematically, it can be seen as
a map :math:`\\mathcal{R} : D \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n} \\rightarrow  \\tilde{X} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{m}`,
with :math:`m \\in \\mathbb{N}` being the (configurable) dimension of the encoding
and :math:`\\tilde{X}` the encoded dataset as vectors.

In other words, let :math:`n \\in \\mathbb{N}` be the amount of features.
A *Reducer* then takes the similarity or dissimilarity matrix :math:`D \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}`
and produces :math:`n` euclidean vectors of dimension :math:`m`.

Currently, the following *Reducers* are implement:
