Accurate and fast cell marker gene identification with COSG
=======================================================================================================

Overview
---------
COSG is a cosine similarity-based method for more accurate and scalable marker gene identification.

- COSG is a general method for cell marker gene identification across different data modalities, e.g., scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq and spatially resolved transcriptome data.
- Marker genes or genomic regions identified by COSG are more indicative and with greater cell-type specificity.
- COSG is ultrafast for large-scale datasets, and is capable of identifying marker genes for one million cells in less than two minutes.

The method and benchmarking results are described in `Dai et al., (2021)`_. 

Documentation
--------------
The documentation for COSG is available `here <https://cosg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

Tutorial
---------

The `COSG tutorial <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/genecell/COSG/blob/main/tutorials/COSG-tutorial.ipynb>`_ provides a quick-start guide for using COSG and demonstrates the superior performance of COSG as compared with other methods, and the `Jupyter notebook <https://github.com/genecell/COSG/blob/main/tutorials/COSG-tutorial.ipynb>`_ is also available.
