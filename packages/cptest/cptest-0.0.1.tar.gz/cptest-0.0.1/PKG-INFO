# CP Test 

This package contains tools to write generators and validators for competitive programming problems.

This work is not even started. I just coded the undirected graph generator by accident for a school project and thought: "Hey, I could make a neat package". Maybe it will complete, or maybe it will sit here for years and once every 2 years someone asks me about it because they've been stalking my Github and I smile and forget about it.
