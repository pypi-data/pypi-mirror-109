"""
Crack detection algorithms

These module contains the different functions for the crack detection. This includes functions for different
sub-algorithms which are used in the final crack detection as well as different methods for the crack detection.
The different crack detection methods are available as functions with an image stack and additional arguments
as input.

class CrackDetectionTWLI:
    r"""
    The basic method from Glud et al. for crack detection without preprocessing.

    This is the basis for a crack detection with this method. Each object from this class
    can be used to detect cracks from images. The workflow of objects from this class is quite easy.

    #. Object instantiation. Create an object from with the input parameter for the crack detection.
    #. Call the method :meth:`~.detect_cracks` with an image as input.
       This method will call all sub-functions of the crack detection.

       #. apply the gabor filter
       #. apply otsuÂ´s threshold to split the image into foreground and background.
       #. skeletonize the foreground
       #. find the cracks in the skeletonized image.

    Shift detection, normalization, and other preprocessing procedures are not performed! It is assumed that
    all the necessary preprocessing is already done for the input image. For preprocessing please use
    the :mod:`~.stack_operations` or other means.

    Parameters
    ----------
    theta: float
        Angle of the cracks in respect to a horizontal line in degrees
    frequency: float, optional
        Frequency of the gabor filter. Default: 0.1
    bandwidth: float, optional
        The bandwidth of the gabor filter, Default: 1
    sigma_x: float, optional
        Standard deviation of the gabor kernel in x-direction. This applies to the kernel before rotation. The
        kernel is then rotated *theta* degrees.
    sigma_y: float, optional
        Standard deviation of the gabor kernel in y-direction. This applies to the kernel before rotation. The
        kernel is then rotated *theta* degrees.
    n_stds: int, optional
        The size of the gabor kernel in standard deviations. A smaller kernel is faster but also less accurate.
        Default: 3
    min_size: int, optional
        The minimal number of pixels a crack can be. Cracks under this size will not get counted. Default: 1
    threshold: str
        Method of determining the threshold between foreground and background. Choose between 'otsu' or 'yen'.
        Generally, yen is not as sensitive as otsu. For blurry images with lots of noise yen is nearly always
        better than otsu.
    sensitivity: float, optional
        Adds or subtracts x percent of the input image range to the Otsu-threshold. E.g. sensitivity=-10 will lower
        the threshold to determine foreground by 10 percent of the input image range. For crack detection with
        bad image quality or lots of artefacts it can be helpful to lower the sensitivity to avoid too much false
        detections.

        Adds or subtracts x percent of the input image range to the Otsu-threshold. E.g. sensitivity=-10 will lower
        the threshold to determine foreground by 10 percent of the input image range. For crack detection with
        bad image quality or lots of artefacts it can be helpful to lower the sensitivity to avoid too much false
        detections.

    Returns
    -------
    rho_c: float
        Crack density [1/px]
    cracks: np.ndarray
        Array with the coordinates of the crack with the following structure:
        ([[x0, y0],[x1,y1], [...]]) where x0 and y0 are the starting coordinates and x1, y1
        the end of one crack. Each crack is represented by a 2x2 array stacked into a bigger array (x,2,2).
    rho_th: float
        A measure how much of the area of the input image is detected as foreground. If the gabor filter can not
        distinguish between cracks with very little space in between the crack detection will break down and
        lead to false results. If this value is high but the crack density is low, this is an indicator that
        the crack detection does not work with the given input parameters and the input image.
