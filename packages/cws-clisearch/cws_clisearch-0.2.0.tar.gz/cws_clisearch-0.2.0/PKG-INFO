Description: # Cws
        
        CLI web search is a CLI search tool that shows the first N results from select search engines.
        
        This started out because I wanted a way to play youtube video's in mpv without needing to open a browser first, because then why not watch it in my browser in the first place. I did find some similar projects but they just opened the results in my browser instead which was once again defeating the point.
        
        The main use-cases are:
        * Searching and fetching youtube/google/'whatever gets implemented' search results from the command line
        * Executing default actions per search provider with the -x flag (see configuration), like opening youtube results in mpv
        * Piping results to external commands to open/play results like your web browser or mpv for youtube
        
        it heavily relies on [rapidapi](https://rapidapi.com/) endpoints for now. Which means you need to register and configure personal API tokens for this to work. See the [configuration](#configuration) section below for more info.
        
        Development is done on irregular intervals, while heavily distracted so expect nothing.
        This is currently a first usable version, that will probably change a lot. Core functionality should stay about the same though.
        
        Todo (for now):
        * Make it possible to configure a default provider
        * -c flag that shows only 1 result and copies that
        * Interactive mode that allows selection of result and applying an action like copy or open
        * Create a more generic way to define search providers. Like yaml files. So google.py and youtube.py can be replaced by them.
        * Add more search providers
        * Possibly add some webscraping fallback for when no api's are configured or free limits are reached
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install cws_clisearch
        ```
        
        ## Configuration
        
        Configuration is done through .yml files either in `$HOME` or `$XDG_HOME/cws/`.
        There's 2 different config files, one mandatory and one optional:
        * .cws_tokens.yml (mandatory)
        * .cws_config.yml (optional)
        
        ### .cws_tokens.yml
        
        This is where your [rapidapi](https://rapidapi.com/) tokens are loaded from.
        
        Example:
        ```yaml
        google: "$token" # Get it from https://rapidapi.com/apigeek/api/google-search3/
        youtube: "$token" # Get it from https://rapidapi.com/marindelija/api/youtube-search-results/
        ```
        
        Use the `--list-providers` option to list all posibilities.
        
        ### .cws_config.yml
        
        This is where you override default settings of cws.
        
        Example with defaults shown:
        ```yaml
        provider:
          youtube:
            default_action: 'mpv'
          google:
            default_action: 'firefox'
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        See `cws -h` for general usage information.
        
        For now Google is the default search provider. The -x option implies -u and -n1, then pipes that output to whatever you want.
        It's also safe to manually use the -u and -n1 options to pipe results. This does not work with mpv, just like `echo '$youtube_url' | mpv` wouldn't. Use -x as a work-around.
