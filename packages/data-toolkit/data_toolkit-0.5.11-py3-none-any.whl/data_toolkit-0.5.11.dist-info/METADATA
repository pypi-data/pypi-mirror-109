# ML & data helper code!
Jakub Langr (c) 2021

## TODO: Central Data Repository

As a PM, I want to be able to quickly look at all the data we have on S3 with sample images.

    * Needs a DB
    * Needs a way of sampling

As a MLE, 

## Installation

```
$ pip install data-toolkit
```

## Development

This project includes a number of helpers in the `Makefile` to streamline common development tasks.

### Environment Setup

The following demonstrates setting up and working with a development environment:

```
### create a virtualenv for development

$ make virtualenv

$ source env/bin/activate


### run dt cli application

$ dt --help


### run pytest / coverage

$ make test
```


### Releasing to PyPi

Before releasing to PyPi, you must configure your login credentials:

**~/.pypirc**:

```
[pypi]
username = YOUR_USERNAME
password = YOUR_PASSWORD
```

Then use the included helper function via the `Makefile`:

```
$ make dist

$ make dist-upload
```
