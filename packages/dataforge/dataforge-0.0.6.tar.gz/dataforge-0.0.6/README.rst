Installation
============

.. note:: Installation in a virtual environment of the type created by the
          `venv module <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`_ or
          `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/>`_ is highly
          recommended.

Dataforge uses `xmarshal <https://github.com/hexdump/xmarshal>`_, which is
compiled using `Cython <https://cython.readthedocs.io/>`_. Thus, prior to
installation, you will need a C compiler:

Linux
    ``sudo apt-get install build-essential``

Mac OS X
    Install Apple’s XCode from the App Store

Windows
    Install `Microsoft's C++ Build Tools <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/>`_ 

To install dataforge::
    
    pip install dataforge


Configuration
=============

For ease of use, many arguments and options for executable commands as well as
many function arguments may be specified in a file called ``config.yaml``
located at the root of your project. For example, you could specify arguments
and options for the ``redcap_export`` command by creating a ``config.yaml``
file containing something like this::

    sources.redcap.api:
        url: https://redcap.uchicago.edu/api/
        project_name: MyREDCapProject
        outdir: tmp/redcap

Management of API Tokens
------------------------

To access a REDCap project via the API, you will need to obtain a REDCap API
token. To avoid having to enter the token each time you export data, it is
convenient to add the token to your system keyring. You may do this with the
following command::

    keyring set <redcap_hostname> [<project_name>]

where ``<redcap_hostname>`` is the hostname of your REDCap server (e.g.,
``redcap.uchicago.edu``) and ``<project_name>`` is an abbreviated (no spaces)
name of the REDCap project (e.g., ``MyREDCapProject``). Although specifying a
project name is not required, doing so will allow you to store API tokens for
multiple projects. When you are asked to enter a password, enter the API token
you obtained for your project.

.. warning:: Do not store your API token in a plaintext or otherwise
             unencrypted file, and do not write it down on a piece of paper.
             If another person were to obtain your API token, he or she would
             have the same access to your REDCap project as you do. If there
             is ever a possibility that your token has been compromised, you
             should immediately regenerate your token.
