Description: # DeepErwin
        
        DeepErwin is python package that implements and optimizes TF 2.x wave function models for numerical solutions to the multi-electron Schrödinger equation.
        
        In particular DeepErwin supports:
        - Optimizing a wavefunction for a single nuclear geometry
        - Optimizing wavefunctions for multiple nuclear geometries in parallel, while sharing neural network weights across these wavefunctions to speed-up optimization
        - Use pre-trained weights of a network to speed-up optimization for entirely new wavefunctions
        
        A detailed description of our method and the corresponding results can be found in our recent [arxiv publication](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.08351.pdf). Please cite this paper, whenever you use any parts of DeepErwin.
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        The quickest way to get started with DeepErwin is to have a look at our documentation. It has a detailed description of our python codebase and will also guide you through several [examples](examples), which should help you to quickly get up-and-running using DeepErwin.
