# dependencynet

This module wraps some data and graph manipulation tools to help analyzing and building representations of directed graphs.

This modules make it easier to build graphs having the properties listed below
- elements can be categorized as levels and resources
- levels consists of composite keys forming a hierarchy, for instance
    - area > country > town
    - group > artifact > version
    - database > table > attribute
    - workflow > step > task
- resource is any element related to a level (and only one), for instance
    - monuments or POI of a town
    - tables used by a task in a workflow
- resources having the same label might be connected to each other to form new dependencies, for instance
    - files in and out of a workflow task  might be connected to each other to form data flows
    - towns may be connected to form a trip if one has a flight out and the other a flight in with the same label

## What can I do with this tool ?

### analyse dependencies in code bases

Which modules are depending of a given module ?

Which modules may be inderectly impacted by a change in some module ?

### analyse of data flows between tasks or microservices

Given lists of input and output tables of a task, what is the data flow ?

Show me the data flow zoomed out at the workflow level and hide out data flow within the workflow


## Stems of this projects

This project stems from the need of featuring out how a large very messy project is made. I started by trying to list and connect elements manually, then I automated some parts. I ended up with a lot of very messy scripts to extract the most visible dependencies and it helped me to draw some schemas in Powerpoint.

This pointed me to the fact that this system was a graph, a network of workflows, treatments, tasks, classes, tables, exported files, external packages, delivery bundles. I could clean up a little bit by representing all these elements as a graph. When this step is done it is easier to select what kind of nodes and links I want to show for a given view or documentation.

I started to rework those scripts in Python notebooks as a side project. It took me a while. Graphs are powerful, but power comes with lots of concepts to master. In the Python ecosystem, networkx is the library to go with graphs. It has a lot of graph manipulation features but charts are not so easy, and charts was the main goal. I found ipycytoscape (a port of cytoscape) easy to use with charts. But I lacked some networkx features. Hopefully there are ways to integrate networkx and cytoscape. I also had a lot of pandas code to collect and build data structues required by the graph libraries. Again, I had a lot of code to maintain in order to achieve my goals.

The last rework is this library. I factored out functions I found useful in the process of building the analyze tool. This is also a way to learn how to make a module library in Python.

Please keep in mind that
- this is a side project
- it is not intended to cover all the needs but a provide a specific subset required to easily build, clean up and show directed graphs of connected elements


## Concepts
The graph production is done in 4 major steps

- Model : build datasource for each type of elements and organize the levels hierarchy
    - Schema : describe the Model metadata (levels, resources, connections)
- GraphModel : represents the Model as a networkx graph
- GraphViewer : encapsulate the steps to show the cytoscape graph
    - StyleBuilder : generates a convenient cytoscape style from the schema
- GraphMLConverter : turns the graph and the style into a GraplML file for Yed
