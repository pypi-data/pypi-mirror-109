### Install with Pip

```bash
$ sudo pip install digital-hydrant
```

### Install from source

Clone this repository

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/outsideopen/digital-hydrant-collectors.git
$ cd ~/digital-hydrant-collectors
$ sudo ./setup.py install
```

## Usage

### Configuration

- Create a new Hydrant on the Digital Hydrant [website](https://app.digitalhydrant.com/hydrants)
- Run the hydrant init script with your api token
  - \*You should delete this command from `.bash_history` as it poses a potential security risk
    - If you have `$HISTCONTROL` set to "ignorespace" or "ignoreboth" then you can add a space before running the command
    - OR you can execute the command with your token and then run `history -d $((HISTCMD-2))` to delete the command from your history

```shell
$ sudo hydrant --init <MY_TOKEN>
```

- OR manually copy the api token to your configuration file at `/etc/digital-hydrant/config.ini`
  - \*If your config file does not yet exist you can run `sudo hydrant --init` to initialize the default config file

```
[api]
token = $MY_TOKEN
```

### Run it

```shell
$ sudo hydrant
```

### Options

```
usage: hydrant [-h] [--init [TOKEN]] [--systemd [LOCATION]] [-c] [-u] [-cq] [-v] [-f]

Run Digital-Hydrant data collectors

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --init [TOKEN]        setup local config file and database. optionally accepts a hydrant's api token
  --systemd [LOCATION]  move the digital-hydrant service file to it's system location (defaults to
                        /usr/lib/systemd/system/)
  -c, --collect         dictates that data collection should be run
  -u, --upload          dictates that stored data should be uploaded
  -cq, --clear-queue    delete all entries from local database
  -v, --version         show program's version number and exit
  -f, --force           runs Digital Hydrant without checking for system dependencies(this may cause
                        errors)

By default, both collection and upload will execute unless otherwise specified
```

### DH_cron

###### In order to schedule collector execution, Digital Hydrant uses a cron-like string with the following structure

- \<day of week(1-7)> \<days> \<hours> \<minutes> \<seconds>
- whichever value is populated first will be read as "every \<value> \<interval>" and the remaining values will be combined and read as "at \<values>"
  - examples:
    - \* 4 18 30 0 = "every 4 days at 18:30:00"
    - 5 \* \* 30 45 = "every thursday at 0:30:45"
- day of the week values start on Sunday (i.e. 1 = Sun... 7 = Sat)
- for DH_cron strings with the day of the week populated, the days value will be ignored
- if no schedule string is provided then the default value of \* \* \* \* \* will be used, indicating that the process should only be run once
