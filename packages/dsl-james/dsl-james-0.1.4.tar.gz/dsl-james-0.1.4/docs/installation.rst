Installation
============


Stable release
--------------

To install startup, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install dsl-james

This is the preferred method to install james, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.

From sources
------------

The sources for startup can be downloaded from the `Github repo`_.

You can either clone the public repository:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone git://github.com/data-science-lab/dsl-james

Or download the `tarball`_:

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl -OJL https://github.com/data-science-lab/dsl-james/tarball/master

Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python setup.py install
