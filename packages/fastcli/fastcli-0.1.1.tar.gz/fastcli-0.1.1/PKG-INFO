        Python3 CLI script for fast.com
        
        - Free software: MIT
        - Documentation: https://fastcli.readthedocs.org
        
        ## Features
        
        Shows approximate download speed by way of Fast.com.
        
        ## Introduction
        
        Fast.com is a newish Netflix download speed test. It bases its results on
        download speed of actual Netflix video content, which makes it much harder for
        ISPs to embellish their results (without also speeding up all of Netflix, which
        may account for as much as 30% of all internet traffic).
        
        It doesn't test upload speed or ping, so `fastcli` doesn't either.
        
        ## Dependencies
        
        - Python >= 3.5
        - See `requirements.txt`
        
        ## Quickstart
        
        ```bash
        pip3 install fastcli
        fastcli
        ```
        
        ### Development Setup
        
        1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/n8henrie/fastcli && cd
           fastcli`
        1. Install into a virtualenv:
        
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        pip3 install .[dev]
        ```
        
        ## Configuration
        
        - Optionally accepts a `--runtime` argument which may affect accuracy by
          changing to values shorter or longer than the default of 10 (seconds).
