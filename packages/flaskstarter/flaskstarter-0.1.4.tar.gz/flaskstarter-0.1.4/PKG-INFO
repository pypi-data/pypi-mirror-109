Description: # flaskstarter
        A Flask project start-up CLI to create modular ready projects.
        
        Flaskstarter assumes you know about Flask microframework and its mechanics in a begginer level. It can be really helpfull if you are still using monolithic aproach, and needs to start using a modular architecture.
        
        To install flaskstarter use the usual:
        
        `pip install flaskstarter`
        
        To see its help:
        
        `flaskstarter --help`
        
        To start a project:
        
        `flaskstarter init project_name`
        
        To see init's help:
        
        `flaskstarter init --help`
        
        After it you'll be prompted about some famous extensions to add to the project requirements.txt.
        
        ## What the project does for you
        
        It creates project tree, a functional virtualenv on .venv, the init and routes files with a helloworld example and a shell/batch scripts to run the project with the virtual enviroment created. It now installs the requirements on project's .venv on POSIX systems.
        
        ## What the project does not do for you
        
        It still can't update init file with modules configurations. On NT systems a batch file is created so user can run and install requirements.txt, but automation of this is still not well tested.
        
        ## Future
        
        As a management tool it will be able to add new modules and inject its configurations onto projects. If you have a good idea, contact me.
