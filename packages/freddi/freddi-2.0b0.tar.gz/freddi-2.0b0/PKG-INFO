Overview
--------

The code solves 1-D evolution equation of Shakura-Sunyaev accretion disk. The
code is developed to simulate fast-rise exponential-decay (FRED) light curves of
low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) for the paper “Determination of the turbulent
parameter in the accretion disks: effects of self-irradiation in 4U 1543-47
during the 2002 outburst” by Lipunova & Malanchev (2017)
[2017MNRAS.468.4735L](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.468.4735L).

Installation
------------

### Docker

If you are familiar with [Docker](http://docker.com) then you can skip all
further installation instructions and go straight to the [Usage section](#usage), using
following string instead of `./freddi`.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
docker run -v "`pwd`":/data --rm -ti hombit/freddi
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Requirements

-   [Boost](http://www.boost.org/) 1.57+

-   [Make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software))

-   C++ compiler with C++11 support, e.g. `gcc` version 4.8+ or `clang` 3.4+

Requirements installation on Debian based systems (e.g. Ubuntu):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
apt-get install g++ make libboost-all-dev
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On Red Hat based systems (e.g. Fedora):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
dnf install gcc-c++ make boost-devel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Freddi` was tested on Linux and macOS.

### Get and compile source files

First go to the path where `Freddi` directory will be located. Then download and
compile it:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
git clone https://github.com/hombit/freddi.git
cd freddi
make
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now it should be executable file `./freddi` in the current directory. If you’d
like to install it to `/usr/local/bin` then do

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
sudo make install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Usage
-----

`Freddi` runs from the command line with inline options and/or with a configuration file. `Freddi`
outputs file `freddi.dat` with distribution of various physical values over
time. If `--fulldata` is specified then files `freddi_%d.dat` for each time step
are created in the same directory with snapshot radial distributions. These
data-files contain whitespace-separated data columns with header lines starting
with `#` symbol. You can set another prefix instead of `freddi` with `--prefix`
option and change the output directory with `--dir` option. If you choose the
Docker way and would like to specify the directory, then avoid using `--dir`
option and just replace `` "`pwd`" `` with some local path (for more details see
[Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes)).

### Options

The full list of command line options is viewed with `--help` option. Default
values are given in brackets.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Physical Background
-------------------

`Freddi` — Fast Rise Exponential Decay: accretion Disk model Implementation — is
designed to solve the differential equation of the viscous evolution of the
Shakura-Sunyaev accretion disk in a stellar binary system. Shakura-Sunyaev disk
is the standard model of accretion of plasma onto the cosmic bodies, like
neutron stars or black holes. Viscous evolution of the accretion disks exibits
itself, for example, in X-ray outbursts of binary stars. Usually, the outbursts
last for several tens of days and many of them are observed by orbital
observatories.

The basic equation of the viscous evolution relates the surface density and
viscous stresses and is of diffusion type. Evolution of the accretion rate can
be found on solving the equation. The distribution of viscous stresss defines
the emission from the source.

The standard model for the accretion disk is implied, which is developed by
[Shakura & Sunyaev (1973)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1973A%26A....24..337S).
The inner boundary of the disk is at the ISCO or can be explicitely set. The
boundary conditions in the disk are the zero stress at the inner boundary and
the zero accretion rate at the outer boundary. The conditions are suitable
during the outbursts in X-ray binary transients with black holes.

In a binary system, the accretion disk is radially confined. In `Freddi`, the
outer radius of the disk can be set explicitely or calculated as the position of
the tidal truncation radius following [Paczynski
(1997)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1977ApJ...216..822P) for small mass ratios
of the black using the approximation by [Suleimanov et al. (2008)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008A%26A...491..267S).

The parameters at the disk central plane are defined by the analytic
approximations ([Suleimanov et al. 2007](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007ARep...51..549S)), valid for the
effective surface temperatures from 10 000 to 100 000 K, approximately. It is
assumed that the gas pressure dominates, the gas is completely ionized, and the
photon opacity is defined by the free-free and free-bound transitions. Opacity
law is for the solar element abundancies and can be chosen from two types: (1)
Kramers' opacity: kappa = 5e24 rho/T\^(7/2) cm2/g (2) approximation to OPAL
tables: kappa = 1.5e20 rho/T\^(5/2) cm2/g ([Bell & Lin
1994](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994ApJ...427..987B))

The disk at each radius is in the "hot" state if the gas is completely ionized.
Otherwise, the disk is considered to be "cold" locally. Alpha-parameter in the
cold parts of the disk is appreciably lower than in the hot parts. Thus the
viscous evolution of the disk should proceed more effectively in the hot parts
of the disk. To simulate this, `Freddi` has an option to control the outer
radius of the hot evolving disk. We assume that the evolution goes through the
quasi-stationary states in the hot zone of variable size. By default, the hot
zone has the constant size, equal to the tidal radius.

The initial distribution of the matter in the disk should be specified with
`--initialcond` option. `Freddi` can start from several types of initial
distributions: power-law distribution of the surface density
`--initialcond=powerSigma`, power-law `--initialcond=powerF` or sinus-law
`--initialcond=sinusF` distribution of the viscous torque, quasi-stationary
distribution `--initialcond=quasistat`. The choice of the initial distribution
defines what type of evolution is to be calculated.

Starting from the quasi-stationary or `sinusF` distribution, the solution
describes the decaying part of the outburst. Zero-time accretion rate through
the inner edge can be set. In other cases, the rise to the peak is also
computed. Then, initial value of viscous torque at the outer radius (can be set
by `--F0`) defines uniquely the initial mass of the disk.

Self-irradiation by the central X-rays heats the outer parts of the disk. A
fraction of the bolometric flux is supposed to illuminate the disk surface. This
results in the larger size of the hot disk if such model is assumed. Also, the
optical flux is increased because the flux outgoing from the disk surface is
proportional to Teff\^4 = Tvis\^4+Tirr\^4. Self-irradiation of the disk is
included in the computation if irradiation parameter is not zero. The simplest
way is to set a constant irradiation factor `--Cirr` (the studies of X-ray novae
suggest the range for Cirr 1e-5—5e-3).

Observed flux depends on the distance to the source and the inclination of the
disk plane. The inclination angle is the angle between the line of sight and the
normal to the disk. The flux, emitted from the disk surface, is defined by the
sum of the visous and irradiating flux, where the viscous flux is calculated
taking into account general relativity effects near the black hole, following
[Page & Thorne
(1974)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1974ApJ...191..499P)
and [Riffert & Herold (1995)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib\_query?bibcode=1995ApJ...450..508R).


Accretion disk wind
-------------------

Presumably, during an outburst there is an outflow in the form of a wind from the 
accretion disk around the compact object. The presence of such a wind in the LMXBs is supported
by modern observations indicating the expansion of ionized matter. Such an outflow of matter,
being an additional  source of angular momentum transfer in the disk, can strongly influence 
its viscous evolution. 

However, the nature of such winds and their  physical characteristics are an open question.
Namely, there are three mechanisms which are considered:
heating of matter by central radiation in optically thin regions of the disk 
([Begelman et al. 1983](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1983ApJ...271...70B), 
[Shields et al. 1986](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1986ApJ...306...90S), 
[Woods et al. 1996](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996ApJ...461..767W)), 
the pressure of the magnetic field of the disk
([Blandford & Payne 1982](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1982MNRAS.199..883B), 
[Habibi & Abbassi 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...887..256H), 
[Nixon & Pringle 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019A%26A...628A.121N))
and the pressure of local radiation at super-Eddington accretion rates
([Shakura & Sunyaev 1973](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1973A%26A....24..337S), 
[Proga & Kallman 2002](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002ApJ...565..455P)). 

`Freddi` is modernized in such a way that it is able to solve the viscous evolution 
equation with an inhomogeneous term that is responsible for the presence of the disk wind.
This term is the dependence of the surface density of the wind mass-loss rate on 
the distance along the disk's surface. Different forms of such dependence correspond 
to different wind models, and to different classes within `Freddi`. 


One can choose a wind model by setting the
`--wind` option. The thermal wind model ([Woods et al. 1996](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996ApJ...461..767W)),
which implies that the outflow of matter occurs due to the heating of the outer parts of the disk
by a central radiation source, can be chosen by setting `--wind=Woods1996`. The option `--wind=Janiuk15`
corresponds to the model from work [Janiuk et al. (2015)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015A%26A...574A..92J)
where the wind is started in the super-Eddington regime. You can also select the `--wind=ToyWind` option, 
which corresponds to a toy wind model when the user sets the wind strength relatively to the accretion rate using the option `--windpow`.

### Compton-heated wind

At the moment, `Freddi` is more focused on simulating outbursts taking into account the thermal wind (`--wind=Woods1996` option). 
For a better understanding, let's discuss a little the physics of the process of launching such a wind 
and its parameters in the code.

In the standard accretion disk model by [Shakura & Sunyaev (1973)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1973A%26A....24..337S) 
the disk is concave, and, as a result, the disk surface is exposed to the central radiation, 
which heats the disk material. As a result, the heated matter, starting from a certain radius, 
begins to leave the accretion disk. This process of heating the matter of the accretion disk by means of Compoton
processes was developed in [Begelman et al. (1983)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1983ApJ...271...70B) and 
[Shields et al. (1986)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1986ApJ...306...90S). 
In a later work [Woods et al. (1996)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996ApJ...461..767W), 
two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic calculations were performed and the 
results of [Shields et al. (1986)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1986ApJ...306...90S) were generalized. 
[Woods et al. (1996)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996ApJ...461..767W) give an expression for the surface density of the mass 
loss rate as a function of distance along the disk's surface. This function is used in `Freddi` 
to taking thermal wind into account.

Choosing option `--wind=Woods1996`, it is necessary to set the value of the ionization parameter Xi
(which is proportional to the ratio of the radiation and gas pressures) by the option `--Xi_max` and the Compoton temperature T_IC 
(which determines the hardness of the irradiating spectrum and the size of the region where the wind operates) by the option `--Tic`.
