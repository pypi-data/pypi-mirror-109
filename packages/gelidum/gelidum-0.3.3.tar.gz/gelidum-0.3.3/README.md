Freeze your objects in python.

| *Caelum est hieme frigidum et gelidum; myrtos oleas quaeque alia assiduo tepore laetantur, aspernatur ac respuit; laurum tamen patitur atque etiam nitidissimam profert, interdum sed non saepius quam sub urbe nostra necat.* | *In winter the air is cold and frosty: myrtles, olives and all other trees which require constant warmth for them to do well, the climate rejects and spurns, though it allows laurel to grow, and even brings it to a luxuriant leaf. Occasionally, however, it kills it, but that does not happen more frequently than in the neighbourhood of Rome.* |

## Introduction
Inspired by the method freeze found in other languages like Javascript,
this package tries to make immutable objects to make it easier avoid
accidental modifications in your code.

## Major highlights
- **freeze** method creates objects with the same attributes of inputs that cannot be expanded or modified.
- Frozen object creation is thread-safe.

## How it works
In case of the builtin types (int, float, str, etc) it makes nothing, as
they are already immutable.

For the list type, a tuple with frozen items is returned.

Tuples are already immutable, so a new tuple with frozen items is returned.

For sets, frozensets of frozen items are returned.

For dicts, it creates a new [frozendict](https://pypi.org/project/frozendict/)
with the keys and frozen values of the original dict.

This package, change the methods \_\_setattr\_\_, \_\_delattr\_\_, \_\_set\_\_,
\_\_setitem\_\_, \_\_delitem\_\_, and \_\_reversed\_\_.

of the object argument and all of its attributed recursively,
making them raise an exception if the developer tries to call them to modify
the attributes of the instance.

## How to use it

### Freeze in the same object
```python
from gelidum import freeze
your_frozen_object = freeze(your_object, inplace=True)
assert(id(your_frozen_object), id(your_object))

# Both raise exception
your_object.attr1 = new_value
your_frozen_object.attr1 = new_value
```

### Freeze in a new object
```python
from gelidum import freeze
# inplace=False by default
your_frozen_object = freeze(your_object, inplace=False)

# Don't raise exception
your_object.attr1 = new_value

# Raises exception
your_frozen_object.attr1 = new_value
```

### Freeze input params
Use the decorator freeze_params to freeze the input parameters
and avoid non-intended modifications:
```python
from typing import List
from gelidum import freeze_params

@freeze_params()
def append_to_list(a_list: List, new_item: int):
    a_list.append(new_item)
```
If freeze_params is called without arguments, all input parameters will be frozen.
Otherwise, passing a set of parameters will inform the decorator of which named
parameters must be frozen.

```python
from typing import List
from gelidum import freeze_params

@freeze_params(params={"list1", "list2"})
def concat_lists_in(dest: List, list1: List, list2: List):
    dest = list1 + list2

# Freeze dest, list1 and list2
concat_lists_in([], list1=[1, 2, 3], list2=[4, 5, 6])

# Freeze list1 and list2
concat_lists_in(dest=[], list1=[1, 2, 3], list2=[4, 5, 6])
```

Always use kwargs unless you want to freeze the args params. A good way to enforce this is by making the
function have keyword-only arguments:

```python
from typing import List
from gelidum import freeze_params

@freeze_params(params={"list1", "list2"})
def concat_lists_in(*, dest: List, list1: List, list2: List):
    dest = list1 + list2
```

Take in account that all freezing is done in a new object (i.e. freeze with inplace=False).
It makes no sense to freeze a parameter of a function that could be used later, *outside*
said function.

### Check original (i.e. "hot") class
- **get_gelidum_hot_class_name**: returns the name of hot class.
- **get_gelidum_hot_class_module** returns the module reference where the hot class was.

## Limitations
- dict, list, tuple and set cannot be modified inplace although the flag inplace is set.
- file handler attributes are not supported. An exception is raised when trying to freeze
  an object with them
- frozen objects cannot be serialized with [marshal](https://docs.python.org/3/library/marshal.html).

## Dependencies
Right now this package uses
[frozendict](https://pypi.org/project/frozendict/) and 

## Roadmap
- [ ] Make some use-cases with threading module.
