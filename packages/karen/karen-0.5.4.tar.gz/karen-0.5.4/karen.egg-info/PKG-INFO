Description: Project Karen Â· |GitHub license| |Python Versions|
        ==================================================
        
        This project is dedicated to building a "Synthetic Human" which is
        called Karen (for now) for which we have assigned the female gender
        pronoun of "She". She has visual face recognition
        (`opencv/opencv <https://github.com/opencv/opencv>`__), speech
        transcription
        (`mozilla/deepspeech <https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech>`__), and
        speech synthesis
        (`festival <http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/>`__). Karen is
        written in Python and is targeted primarily at the single board computer
        (SBC) platforms like the `Raspberry
        Pi <https://www.raspberrypi.org/>`__.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        You will likely need a few extra packages and libraries to run Karen's
        core routines. The details on all of this is available on our
        installation page at the link below.

        Install from PyPi
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        ::
        
            pip3 install karen
        
        Mozilla DeepSpeech Models
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        To download the speech models you can use the script below or visit the
        `DeepSpeech <https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech>`__ page:
        
        ::
        
            wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lnxusr1/karen/0ab615ead3862326d69926294267f0a8669886dd/models/speech/download-models.sh
            sh ./download-models.sh
        
        Starting Up
        -----------
        
        There are lots of ways to leverage karen. You can import the device
        modules like listener and use on its own or you can start the entire
        process. Check out the "run.py" for some ideas on how to build a device
        container and add input/output devices to it.
        
        To run Karen in the entirety:
        
        ::
        
            import karen
            karen.start('/path/to/config.json')
        
        **NOTICE** - Karen is under development against Python 3. She is not
        compatible with Python 2 so be sure to use "python3" or "python3" (and
        install the related binaries if needed).
        
        Project Goals
        -------------
        
        I'm not sure where we will end up but the goals for this project are
        pretty simple:
        
        1. Must be able to do every day tasks (tell time, weather, and be
           context aware)
        2. Must provide evidence of "thought" (I'm still working on what exactly
           this means)
        3. Must be fun (because the moment it becomes "work" I'm sure we'll all
           lose interest)
