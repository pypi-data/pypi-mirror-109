This is a fork of [`jnwatson`'s LMDB bindings in Python](https://github.com/jnwatson/py-lmdb). It increases the key and page sizes so that Lamden's unstructured and human readable data can be accessed and stored unhashed.

It takes the name `lamdb` from LMDB and Lamden and is stored on Pypi so that it can be deployed across a standard package manager.
