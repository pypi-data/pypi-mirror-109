        ## Interprocess and thread safe light weight cache
        
        **Note:**
        This is under development and has bad performance (concurrency, response time, error prone, etc. you name it!). 
        It is not ready for production use.  If you like taking risks, I won't stop you from using it.
        
        ## Timeline
        
         - [ ] Write unittests
         - [ ] Stress testing
         - [ ] Improve error handling
         - [ ] Extension to current implementation: Implement connection pool and client reuse connections
         - [ ] Implementation 2: Twisted bsaed concurrency
         - [ ] Implementation 3: Incordinated cache (file db + locks for synchronization)
         - [ ] For each implementation, perform benchmark tests and stress testing
         - [ ] Release to PyPi
         - [ ] Implementation 4: Named PIPE based approach and full duplex communication
         - [ ] Add more features (snapshot, Cache expiry, etc.)
         - [ ] Production ready code
