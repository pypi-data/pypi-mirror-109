Description: # mastermind
        
        This package allows you to play Mastermind directly into a jupyter notebook/lab IDE. It has been made using the great [ipywidgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) python library.
        
        ## Install
        
            pip install mastermind
        
        ## How to use in a jupyter notebook
        
        Copy and paste the following lines into a cell of a notebook and run it:
        
            from mastermind import MastermindNotebook
            game = MastermindNotebook()
        
        The game should display, you can start playing by choosing one color for each position and click on "Confirm combination" button !

        ## How to use in jupyter lab
        
        To use in jupyter lab, don't forget to install the jupyter widget extension:
        
            jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager
        
        Once this is done, you can proceed in the same way as for the jupyter notebook use.
        
        ## State of development
        
        * A Tkinter interface must be developed to play outside a notebook, feel free to contribute !
        
        * Add a DB to record all the games for one user
