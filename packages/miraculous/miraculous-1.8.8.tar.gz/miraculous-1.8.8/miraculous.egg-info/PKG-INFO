# D.py-M
Greeting! Welcome to my miraculous bot repository!
Here's how to setup!
# Setup process
1. If you gonna host on your pc edit last line to be bot.run("token"). If you're gonna host on  repl add .env file and add TO=token. If you're gonna to host with heroku I have file ready for you just edit config var to be KEY TO VALUE bot token
2. Then fire it up it should show your bot name id and stuff
Default prefix is "m." you can change at bot variable

# But I just download this from pypi
Just use 

```py
from miraculous import login

login(token="bot token",needwebserver=False)

```
needwebserver You can just pass it with bool or leave it if you don't use replit
Or if you use enviroment variable
```py
from miraculous import login
from os import getenv

login(token=getenv("your enviroment variable!"))
```
## What I just fixed?
- Not realtime volume changing
- Loop don't work
- Pausing and Resuming is not work
- Changed how it play music without downloading
## What I just don't fixed yet?
- Sound doesn't change when looping
# Errors?
Please ensure you have all module by do
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
And check your token is not none if you are using enviroment variable method
```bash
python yourscriptname.py
