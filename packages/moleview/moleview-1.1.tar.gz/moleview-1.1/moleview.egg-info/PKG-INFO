## Development

What you can help improve MoleView :)

- Visualization of a large molecule in matplotlib is still slow. It would be great if we can make it faster.
- Is it possible to make MoleView displays animation of a trajectory file that contains a number of structures? 
- Is it possible to speed up the performance using GPU? 
- It would be very great if MoleView can provide analysis functions such as molecular orbitals, density, ...

All pull requests, issues, comments and suggestions are welcome.
