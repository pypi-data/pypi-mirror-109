<!--END STABILITY BANNER-->

This package contains Actions that can be used in a CodePipeline.

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
from aws_cdk import aws_codepipeline as codepipeline
from aws_cdk import aws_codepipeline_actions as codepipeline_actions
```

## Sources

### AWS CodeCommit

To use a CodeCommit Repository in a CodePipeline:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
from aws_cdk import aws_codecommit as codecommit


repo = codecommit.Repository(self, "Repo")

pipeline = codepipeline.Pipeline(self, "MyPipeline",
    pipeline_name="MyPipeline"
)
source_output = codepipeline.Artifact()
source_action = codepipeline_actions.CodeCommitSourceAction(
    action_name="CodeCommit",
    repository=repo,
    output=source_output
)
pipeline.add_stage(
    stage_name="Source",
    actions=[source_action]
)
```

If you want to use existing role which can be used by on commit event rule.
You can specify the role object in eventRole property.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
event_role = iam.Role.from_role_arn(self, "Event-role", "roleArn")
source_action = codepipeline_actions.CodeCommitSourceAction(
    action_name="CodeCommit",
    repository=repo,
    output=codepipeline.Artifact(),
    event_role=event_role
)
```

If you want to clone the entire CodeCommit repository (only available for CodeBuild actions),
you can set the `codeBuildCloneOutput` property to `true`:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
source_output = codepipeline.Artifact()
source_action = codepipeline_actions.CodeCommitSourceAction(
    action_name="CodeCommit",
    repository=repo,
    output=source_output,
    code_build_clone_output=True
)

build_action = codepipeline_actions.CodeBuildAction(
    action_name="CodeBuild",
    project=project,
    input=source_output, # The build action must use the CodeCommitSourceAction output as input.
    outputs=[codepipeline.Artifact()]
)
```

The CodeCommit source action emits variables:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
source_action = codepipeline_actions.CodeCommitSourceAction(
    # ...
    variables_namespace="MyNamespace"
)

# later:

codepipeline_actions.CodeBuildAction(
    # ...
    environment_variables={
        "COMMIT_ID": {
            "value": source_action.variables.commit_id
        }
    }
)
```

### GitHub

If you want to use a GitHub repository as the source, you must create:

* A [GitHub Access Token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line),
  with scopes **repo** and **admin:repo_hook**.
* A [Secrets Manager Secret](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/manage_create-basic-secret.html)
  with the value of the **GitHub Access Token**. Pick whatever name you want (for example `my-github-token`).
  This token can be stored either as Plaintext or as a Secret key/value.
  If you stored the token as Plaintext,
  set `cdk.SecretValue.secretsManager('my-github-token')` as the value of `oauthToken`.
  If you stored it as a Secret key/value,
  you must set `cdk.SecretValue.secretsManager('my-github-token', { jsonField : 'my-github-token' })` as the value of `oauthToken`.

To use GitHub as the source of a CodePipeline:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
# Read the secret from Secrets Manager
source_output = codepipeline.Artifact()
source_action = codepipeline_actions.GitHubSourceAction(
    action_name="GitHub_Source",
    owner="awslabs",
    repo="aws-cdk",
    oauth_token=cdk.SecretValue.secrets_manager("my-github-token"),
    output=source_output,
    branch="develop"
)
pipeline.add_stage(
    stage_name="Source",
    actions=[source_action]
)
```

The GitHub source action emits variables:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
source_action = codepipeline_actions.GitHubSourceAction(
    # ...
    variables_namespace="MyNamespace"
)

# later:

codepipeline_actions.CodeBuildAction(
    # ...
    environment_variables={
        "COMMIT_URL": {
            "value": source_action.variables.commit_url
        }
    }
)
```

### BitBucket

CodePipeline can use a BitBucket Git repository as a source:

**Note**: you have to manually connect CodePipeline through the AWS Console with your BitBucket account.
This is a one-time operation for a given AWS account in a given region.
The simplest way to do that is to either start creating a new CodePipeline,
or edit an existing one, while being logged in to BitBucket.
Choose BitBucket as the source,
and grant CodePipeline permissions to your BitBucket account.
Copy & paste the Connection ARN that you get in the console,
or use the [`codestar-connections list-connections` AWS CLI operation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/codestar-connections/list-connections.html)
to find it.
After that, you can safely abort creating or editing the pipeline -
the connection has already been created.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
source_output = codepipeline.Artifact()
source_action = codepipeline_actions.CodeStarConnectionsSourceAction(
    action_name="BitBucket_Source",
    owner="aws",
    repo="aws-cdk",
    output=source_output,
    connection_arn="arn:aws:codestar-connections:us-east-1:123456789012:connection/12345678-abcd-12ab-34cdef5678gh"
)
```

You can also use the `CodeStarConnectionsSourceAction` to connect to GitHub, in the same way
(you just have to select GitHub as the source when creating the connection in the console).

### AWS S3 Source

To use an S3 Bucket as a source in CodePipeline:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
from aws_cdk import aws_s3 as s3


source_bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "MyBucket",
    versioned=True
)

pipeline = codepipeline.Pipeline(self, "MyPipeline")
source_output = codepipeline.Artifact()
source_action = codepipeline_actions.S3SourceAction(
    action_name="S3Source",
    bucket=source_bucket,
    bucket_key="path/to/file.zip",
    output=source_output
)
pipeline.add_stage(
    stage_name="Source",
    actions=[source_action]
)
```

The region of the action will be determined by the region the bucket itself is in.
When using a newly created bucket,
that region will be taken from the stack the bucket belongs to;
for an imported bucket,
you can specify the region explicitly:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
source_bucket = s3.Bucket.from_bucket_attributes(self, "SourceBucket",
    bucket_name="my-bucket",
    region="ap-southeast-1"
)
```

By default, the Pipeline will poll the Bucket to detect changes.
You can change that behavior to use CloudWatch Events by setting the `trigger`
property to `S3Trigger.EVENTS` (it's `S3Trigger.POLL` by default).
If you do that, make sure the source Bucket is part of an AWS CloudTrail Trail -
otherwise, the CloudWatch Events will not be emitted,
and your Pipeline will not react to changes in the Bucket.
You can do it through the CDK:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
from aws_cdk import aws_cloudtrail as cloudtrail


key = "some/key.zip"
trail = cloudtrail.Trail(self, "CloudTrail")
trail.add_s3_event_selector([S3EventSelector(
    bucket=source_bucket,
    object_prefix=key
)],
    read_write_type=cloudtrail.ReadWriteType.WRITE_ONLY
)
source_action = codepipeline_actions.S3SourceAction(
    action_name="S3Source",
    bucket_key=key,
    bucket=source_bucket,
    output=source_output,
    trigger=codepipeline_actions.S3Trigger.EVENTS
)
```

The S3 source action emits variables:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
source_action = codepipeline_actions.S3SourceAction(
    # ...
    variables_namespace="MyNamespace"
)

# later:

codepipeline_actions.CodeBuildAction(
    # ...
    environment_variables={
        "VERSION_ID": {
            "value": source_action.variables.version_id
        }
    }
)
```

### AWS ECR

To use an ECR Repository as a source in a Pipeline:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
from aws_cdk import aws_ecr as ecr


pipeline = codepipeline.Pipeline(self, "MyPipeline")
source_output = codepipeline.Artifact()
source_action = codepipeline_actions.EcrSourceAction(
    action_name="ECR",
    repository=ecr_repository,
    image_tag="some-tag", # optional, default: 'latest'
    output=source_output
)
pipeline.add_stage(
    stage_name="Source",
    actions=[source_action]
)
```

The ECR source action emits variables:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
source_action = codepipeline_actions.EcrSourceAction(
    # ...
    variables_namespace="MyNamespace"
)

# later:

codepipeline_actions.CodeBuildAction(
    # ...
    environment_variables={
        "IMAGE_URI": {
            "value": source_action.variables.image_uri
        }
    }
)
```

## Build & test

### AWS CodeBuild

Example of a CodeBuild Project used in a Pipeline, alongside CodeCommit:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
from aws_cdk import aws_codebuild as codebuild
from aws_cdk import aws_codecommit as codecommit


repository = codecommit.Repository(self, "MyRepository",
    repository_name="MyRepository"
)
project = codebuild.PipelineProject(self, "MyProject")

source_output = codepipeline.Artifact()
source_action = codepipeline_actions.CodeCommitSourceAction(
    action_name="CodeCommit",
    repository=repository,
    output=source_output
)
build_action = codepipeline_actions.CodeBuildAction(
    action_name="CodeBuild",
    project=project,
    input=source_output,
    outputs=[codepipeline.Artifact()], # optional
    execute_batch_build=True
)

codepipeline.Pipeline(self, "MyPipeline",
    stages=[{
        "stage_name": "Source",
        "actions": [source_action]
    }, {
        "stage_name": "Build",
        "actions": [build_action]
    }
    ]
)
```

The default category of the CodeBuild Action is `Build`;
if you want a `Test` Action instead,
override the `type` property:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
test_action = codepipeline_actions.CodeBuildAction(
    action_name="IntegrationTest",
    project=project,
    input=source_output,
    type=codepipeline_actions.CodeBuildActionType.TEST
)
```

#### Multiple inputs and outputs

When you want to have multiple inputs and/or outputs for a Project used in a
Pipeline, instead of using the `secondarySources` and `secondaryArtifacts`
properties of the `Project` class, you need to use the `extraInputs` and
`outputs` properties of the CodeBuild CodePipeline
Actions. Example:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
source_output1 = codepipeline.Artifact()
source_action1 = codepipeline_actions.CodeCommitSourceAction(
    action_name="Source1",
    repository=repository1,
    output=source_output1
)
source_output2 = codepipeline.Artifact("source2")
source_action2 = codepipeline_actions.CodeCommitSourceAction(
    action_name="Source2",
    repository=repository2,
    output=source_output2
)

build_action = codepipeline_actions.CodeBuildAction(
    action_name="Build",
    project=project,
    input=source_output1,
    extra_inputs=[source_output2
    ],
    outputs=[
        codepipeline.Artifact("artifact1"), # for better buildspec readability - see below
        codepipeline.Artifact("artifact2")
    ]
)
```

**Note**: when a CodeBuild Action in a Pipeline has more than one output, it
only uses the `secondary-artifacts` field of the buildspec, never the
primary output specification directly under `artifacts`. Because of that, it
pays to explicitly name all output artifacts of that Action, like we did
above, so that you know what name to use in the buildspec.

Example buildspec for the above project:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
project = codebuild.PipelineProject(self, "MyProject",
    build_spec=codebuild.BuildSpec.from_object(
        version="0.2",
        phases={
            "build": {
                "commands": []
            }
        },
        artifacts={
            "secondary-artifacts": {
                "artifact1": {},
                "artifact2": {}
            }
        }
    )
)
```

#### Variables

The CodeBuild action emits variables.
Unlike many other actions, the variables are not static,
but dynamic, defined in the buildspec,
in the 'exported-variables' subsection of the 'env' section.
Example:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
build_action = codepipeline_actions.CodeBuildAction(
    action_name="Build1",
    input=source_output,
    project=codebuild.PipelineProject(self, "Project",
        build_spec=codebuild.BuildSpec.from_object(
            version="0.2",
            env={
                "exported-variables": ["MY_VAR"
                ]
            },
            phases={
                "build": {
                    "commands": "export MY_VAR=\"some value\""
                }
            }
        )
    ),
    variables_namespace="MyNamespace"
)

# later:

codepipeline_actions.CodeBuildAction(
    # ...
    environment_variables={
        "MyVar": {
            "value": build_action.variable("MY_VAR")
        }
    }
)
```

### Jenkins

In order to use Jenkins Actions in the Pipeline,
you first need to create a `JenkinsProvider`:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
jenkins_provider = codepipeline_actions.JenkinsProvider(self, "JenkinsProvider",
    provider_name="MyJenkinsProvider",
    server_url="http://my-jenkins.com:8080",
    version="2"
)
```

If you've registered a Jenkins provider in a different CDK app,
or outside the CDK (in the CodePipeline AWS Console, for example),
you can import it:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
jenkins_provider = codepipeline_actions.JenkinsProvider.import(self, "JenkinsProvider",
    provider_name="MyJenkinsProvider",
    server_url="http://my-jenkins.com:8080",
    version="2"
)
```

Note that a Jenkins provider
(identified by the provider name-category(build/test)-version tuple)
must always be registered in the given account, in the given AWS region,
before it can be used in CodePipeline.

With a `JenkinsProvider`,
we can create a Jenkins Action:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
build_action = codepipeline_actions.JenkinsAction(
    action_name="JenkinsBuild",
    jenkins_provider=jenkins_provider,
    project_name="MyProject",
    type=codepipeline_actions.JenkinsActionType.BUILD
)
```

## Deploy

### AWS CloudFormation

This module contains Actions that allows you to deploy to CloudFormation from AWS CodePipeline.

For example, the following code fragment defines a pipeline that automatically deploys a CloudFormation template
directly from a CodeCommit repository, with a manual approval step in between to confirm the changes:

[example Pipeline to deploy CloudFormation](test/integ.cfn-template-from-repo.lit.ts)

See [the AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/continuous-delivery-codepipeline.html)
for more details about using CloudFormation in CodePipeline.

#### Actions defined by this package

This package contains the following CloudFormation actions:

* **CloudFormationCreateUpdateStackAction** - Deploy a CloudFormation template directly from the pipeline. The indicated stack is created,
  or updated if it already exists. If the stack is in a failure state, deployment will fail (unless `replaceOnFailure`
  is set to `true`, in which case it will be destroyed and recreated).
* **CloudFormationDeleteStackAction** - Delete the stack with the given name.
* **CloudFormationCreateReplaceChangeSetAction** - Prepare a change set to be applied later. You will typically use change sets if you want
  to manually verify the changes that are being staged, or if you want to separate the people (or system) preparing the
  changes from the people (or system) applying the changes.
* **CloudFormationExecuteChangeSetAction** - Execute a change set prepared previously.

#### Lambda deployed through CodePipeline

If you want to deploy your Lambda through CodePipeline,
and you don't use assets (for example, because your CDK code and Lambda code are separate),
you can use a special Lambda `Code` class, `CfnParametersCode`.
Note that your Lambda must be in a different Stack than your Pipeline.
The Lambda itself will be deployed, alongside the entire Stack it belongs to,
using a CloudFormation CodePipeline Action. Example:

[Example of deploying a Lambda through CodePipeline](test/integ.lambda-deployed-through-codepipeline.lit.ts)

#### Cross-account actions

If you want to update stacks in a different account,
pass the `account` property when creating the action:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
codepipeline_actions.CloudFormationCreateUpdateStackAction(
    # ...
    account="123456789012"
)
```

This will create a new stack, called `<PipelineStackName>-support-123456789012`, in your `App`,
that will contain the role that the pipeline will assume in account 123456789012 before executing this action.
This support stack will automatically be deployed before the stack containing the pipeline.

You can also pass a role explicitly when creating the action -
in that case, the `account` property is ignored,
and the action will operate in the same account the role belongs to:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
from aws_cdk import PhysicalName


# in stack for account 123456789012...
action_role = iam.Role(other_account_stack, "ActionRole",
    assumed_by=iam.AccountPrincipal(pipeline_account),
    # the role has to have a physical name set
    role_name=PhysicalName.GENERATE_IF_NEEDED
)

# in the pipeline stack...
codepipeline_actions.CloudFormationCreateUpdateStackAction(
    # ...
    role=action_role
)
```

### AWS CodeDeploy

#### Server deployments

To use CodeDeploy for EC2/on-premise deployments in a Pipeline:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
from aws_cdk import aws_codedeploy as codedeploy


pipeline = codepipeline.Pipeline(self, "MyPipeline",
    pipeline_name="MyPipeline"
)

# add the source and build Stages to the Pipeline...

deploy_action = codepipeline_actions.CodeDeployServerDeployAction(
    action_name="CodeDeploy",
    input=build_output,
    deployment_group=deployment_group
)
pipeline.add_stage(
    stage_name="Deploy",
    actions=[deploy_action]
)
```

##### Lambda deployments

To use CodeDeploy for blue-green Lambda deployments in a Pipeline:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
lambda_code = lambda_.Code.from_cfn_parameters()
func = lambda_.Function(lambda_stack, "Lambda",
    code=lambda_code,
    handler="index.handler",
    runtime=lambda_.Runtime.NODEJS_12_X
)
# used to make sure each CDK synthesis produces a different Version
version = func.add_version("NewVersion")
alias = lambda_.Alias(lambda_stack, "LambdaAlias",
    alias_name="Prod",
    version=version
)

codedeploy.LambdaDeploymentGroup(lambda_stack, "DeploymentGroup",
    alias=alias,
    deployment_config=codedeploy.LambdaDeploymentConfig.LINEAR_10PERCENT_EVERY_1MINUTE
)
```

Then, you need to create your Pipeline Stack,
where you will define your Pipeline,
and deploy the `lambdaStack` using a CloudFormation CodePipeline Action
(see above for a complete example).

### ECS

CodePipeline can deploy an ECS service.
The deploy Action receives one input Artifact which contains the [image definition file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/pipelines-create.html#pipelines-create-image-definitions):

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
deploy_stage = pipeline.add_stage(
    stage_name="Deploy",
    actions=[
        codepipeline_actions.EcsDeployAction(
            action_name="DeployAction",
            service=service,
            # if your file is called imagedefinitions.json,
            # use the `input` property,
            # and leave out the `imageFile` property
            input=build_output,
            # if your file name is _not_ imagedefinitions.json,
            # use the `imageFile` property,
            # and leave out the `input` property
            image_file=build_output.at_path("imageDef.json"),
            deployment_timeout=cdk.Duration.minutes(60)
        )
    ]
)
```

#### Deploying ECS applications stored in a separate source code repository

The idiomatic CDK way of deploying an ECS application is to have your Dockerfiles and your CDK code in the same source code repository,
leveraging [Docker Assets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/assets.html#assets_types_docker),
and use the [CDK Pipelines module](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/pipelines-readme.html).

However, if you want to deploy a Docker application whose source code is kept in a separate version control repository than the CDK code,
you can use the `TagParameterContainerImage` class from the ECS module.
Here's an example:

[example ECS pipeline for an application in a separate source code repository](test/integ.pipeline-ecs-separate-source.lit.ts)

### AWS S3 Deployment

To use an S3 Bucket as a deployment target in CodePipeline:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
target_bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "MyBucket")

pipeline = codepipeline.Pipeline(self, "MyPipeline")
deploy_action = codepipeline_actions.S3DeployAction(
    action_name="S3Deploy",
    stage=deploy_stage,
    bucket=target_bucket,
    input=source_output
)
deploy_stage = pipeline.add_stage(
    stage_name="Deploy",
    actions=[deploy_action]
)
```

#### Invalidating the CloudFront cache when deploying to S3

There is currently no native support in CodePipeline for invalidating a CloudFront cache after deployment.
One workaround is to add another build step after the deploy step,
and use the AWS CLI to invalidate the cache:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
# Create a Cloudfront Web Distribution
distribution = cloudfront.Distribution(self, "Distribution")

# Create the build project that will invalidate the cache
invalidate_build_project = codebuild.PipelineProject(self, "InvalidateProject",
    build_spec=codebuild.BuildSpec.from_object(
        version="0.2",
        phases={
            "build": {
                "commands": ["aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id ${CLOUDFRONT_ID} --paths \"/*\""
                ]
            }
        }
    ),
    environment_variables={
        "CLOUDFRONT_ID": {"value": distribution.distribution_id}
    }
)

# Add Cloudfront invalidation permissions to the project
distribution_arn = f"arn:aws:cloudfront::{this.account}:distribution/{distribution.distributionId}"
invalidate_build_project.add_to_role_policy(iam.PolicyStatement(
    resources=[distribution_arn],
    actions=["cloudfront:CreateInvalidation"
    ]
))

# Create the pipeline (here only the S3 deploy and Invalidate cache build)
codepipeline.Pipeline(self, "Pipeline",
    stages=[{
        "stage_name": "Deploy",

                run_order=2
            )
        ]
    }
    ]
)
```

### Alexa Skill

You can deploy to Alexa using CodePipeline with the following Action:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
# Read the secrets from ParameterStore
client_id = cdk.SecretValue.secrets_manager("AlexaClientId")
client_secret = cdk.SecretValue.secrets_manager("AlexaClientSecret")
refresh_token = cdk.SecretValue.secrets_manager("AlexaRefreshToken")

# Add deploy action
codepipeline_actions.AlexaSkillDeployAction(
    action_name="DeploySkill",
    run_order=1,
    input=source_output,
    client_id=client_id.to_string(),
    client_secret=client_secret,
    refresh_token=refresh_token,
    skill_id="amzn1.ask.skill.12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012"
)
```

If you need manifest overrides you can specify them as `parameterOverridesArtifact` in the action:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
from aws_cdk import aws_cloudformation as cloudformation


# Deploy some CFN change set and store output
execute_output = codepipeline.Artifact("CloudFormation")
execute_change_set_action = codepipeline_actions.CloudFormationExecuteChangeSetAction(
    action_name="ExecuteChangesTest",
    run_order=2,
    stack_name=stack_name,
    change_set_name=change_set_name,
    output_file_name="overrides.json",
    output=execute_output
)

# Provide CFN output as manifest overrides
codepipeline_actions.AlexaSkillDeployAction(
    action_name="DeploySkill",
    run_order=1,
    input=source_output,
    parameter_overrides_artifact=execute_output,
    client_id=client_id.to_string(),
    client_secret=client_secret,
    refresh_token=refresh_token,
    skill_id="amzn1.ask.skill.12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012"
)
```

### AWS Service Catalog

You can deploy a CloudFormation template to an existing Service Catalog product with the following Action:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
service_catalog_deploy_action = codepipeline_actions.ServiceCatalogDeployActionBeta1(
    action_name="ServiceCatalogDeploy",
    template_path=cdk_build_output.at_path("Sample.template.json"),
    product_version_name="Version - " + Date.now.to_string,
    product_type="CLOUD_FORMATION_TEMPLATE",
    product_version_description="This is a version from the pipeline with a new description.",
    product_id="prod-XXXXXXXX"
)
```

## Approve & invoke

### Manual approval Action

This package contains an Action that stops the Pipeline until someone manually clicks the approve button:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
manual_approval_action = codepipeline_actions.ManualApprovalAction(
    action_name="Approve",
    notification_topic=sns.Topic(self, "Topic"), # optional
    notify_emails=["some_email@example.com"
    ], # optional
    additional_information="additional info"
)
approve_stage.add_action(manual_approval_action)
```

If the `notificationTopic` has not been provided,
but `notifyEmails` were,
a new SNS Topic will be created
(and accessible through the `notificationTopic` property of the Action).

### AWS Lambda

This module contains an Action that allows you to invoke a Lambda function in a Pipeline:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
from aws_cdk import aws_lambda as lambda_


pipeline = codepipeline.Pipeline(self, "MyPipeline")
lambda_action = codepipeline_actions.LambdaInvokeAction(
    action_name="Lambda",
    lambda_=fn
)
pipeline.add_stage(
    stage_name="Lambda",
    actions=[lambda_action]
)
```

The Lambda Action can have up to 5 inputs,
and up to 5 outputs:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
lambda_action = codepipeline_actions.LambdaInvokeAction(
    action_name="Lambda",
    inputs=[source_output, build_output
    ],
    outputs=[
        codepipeline.Artifact("Out1"),
        codepipeline.Artifact("Out2")
    ],
    lambda_=fn
)
```

The Lambda invoke action emits variables.
Unlike many other actions, the variables are not static,
but dynamic, defined by the function calling the `PutJobSuccessResult`
API with the `outputVariables` property filled with the map of variables
Example:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
from aws_cdk import aws_lambda as lambda_


lambda_invoke_action = codepipeline_actions.LambdaInvokeAction(
    action_name="Lambda",
    lambda_=lambda_.Function(self, "Func",
        runtime=lambda_.Runtime.NODEJS_12_X,
        handler="index.handler",
        code=lambda_.Code.from_inline("""
                    const AWS = require('aws-sdk');

                    exports.handler = async function(event, context) {
                        const codepipeline = new AWS.CodePipeline();
                        await codepipeline.putJobSuccessResult({
                            jobId: event['CodePipeline.job'].id,
                            outputVariables: {
                                MY_VAR: "some value",
                            },
                        }).promise();
                    }
                """)
    ),
    variables_namespace="MyNamespace"
)

# later:

codepipeline_actions.CodeBuildAction(
    # ...
    environment_variables={
        "MyVar": {
            "value": lambda_invoke_action.variable("MY_VAR")
        }
    }
)
```

See [the AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/actions-invoke-lambda-function.html)
on how to write a Lambda function invoked from CodePipeline.

### AWS Step Functions

This module contains an Action that allows you to invoke a Step Function in a Pipeline:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
from aws_cdk import aws_stepfunctions as stepfunction


pipeline = codepipeline.Pipeline(self, "MyPipeline")
start_state = stepfunction.Pass(stack, "StartState")
simple_state_machine = stepfunction.StateMachine(stack, "SimpleStateMachine",
    definition=start_state
)
step_function_action = codepipeline_actions.StepFunctionsInvokeAction(
    action_name="Invoke",
    state_machine=simple_state_machine,
    state_machine_input=codepipeline_actions.StateMachineInput.literal(IsHelloWorldExample=True)
)
pipeline.add_stage(
    stage_name="StepFunctions",
    actions=[step_function_action]
)
```

The `StateMachineInput` can be created with one of 2 static factory methods:
`literal`, which takes an arbitrary map as its only argument, or `filePath`:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
from aws_cdk import aws_stepfunctions as stepfunction


pipeline = codepipeline.Pipeline(self, "MyPipeline")
input_artifact = codepipeline.Artifact()
start_state = stepfunction.Pass(stack, "StartState")
simple_state_machine = stepfunction.StateMachine(stack, "SimpleStateMachine",
    definition=start_state
)
step_function_action = codepipeline_actions.StepFunctionsInvokeAction(
    action_name="Invoke",
    state_machine=simple_state_machine,
    state_machine_input=codepipeline_actions.StateMachineInput.file_path(input_artifact.at_path("assets/input.json"))
)
pipeline.add_stage(
    stage_name="StepFunctions",
    actions=[step_function_action]
)
```

See [the AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/action-reference-StepFunctions.html)
for information on Action structure reference.

        :param admin_permissions: (experimental) Whether to grant full permissions to CloudFormation while deploying this template. Setting this to ``true`` affects the defaults for ``role`` and ``capabilities``, if you don't specify any alternatives. The default role that will be created for you will have full (i.e., ``*``) permissions on all resources, and the deployment will have named IAM capabilities (i.e., able to create all IAM resources). This is a shorthand that you can use if you fully trust the templates that are deployed in this pipeline. If you want more fine-grained permissions, use ``addToRolePolicy`` and ``capabilities`` to control what the CloudFormation deployment is allowed to do.
        :param change_set_name: (experimental) Name of the change set to create or update.
        :param stack_name: (experimental) The name of the stack to apply this action to.
        :param template_path: (experimental) Input artifact with the ChangeSet's CloudFormation template.
        :param account: (experimental) The AWS account this Action is supposed to operate in. **Note**: if you specify the ``role`` property, this is ignored - the action will operate in the same region the passed role does. Default: - action resides in the same account as the pipeline
        :param capabilities: (deprecated) Acknowledge certain changes made as part of deployment. For stacks that contain certain resources, explicit acknowledgement that AWS CloudFormation might create or update those resources. For example, you must specify ``AnonymousIAM`` or ``NamedIAM`` if your stack template contains AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) resources. For more information see the link below. Default: None, unless ``adminPermissions`` is true
        :param cfn_capabilities: (experimental) Acknowledge certain changes made as part of deployment. For stacks that contain certain resources, explicit acknowledgement is required that AWS CloudFormation might create or update those resources. For example, you must specify ``ANONYMOUS_IAM`` or ``NAMED_IAM`` if your stack template contains AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) resources. For more information, see the link below. Default: None, unless ``adminPermissions`` is true
        :param deployment_role: (experimental) IAM role to assume when deploying changes. If not specified, a fresh role is created. The role is created with zero permissions unless ``adminPermissions`` is true, in which case the role will have full permissions. Default: A fresh role with full or no permissions (depending on the value of ``adminPermissions``).
        :param extra_inputs: (experimental) The list of additional input Artifacts for this Action. This is especially useful when used in conjunction with the ``parameterOverrides`` property. For example, if you have: parameterOverrides: { 'Param1': action1.outputArtifact.bucketName, 'Param2': action2.outputArtifact.objectKey, } , if the output Artifacts of ``action1`` and ``action2`` were not used to set either the ``templateConfiguration`` or the ``templatePath`` properties, you need to make sure to include them in the ``extraInputs`` - otherwise, you'll get an "unrecognized Artifact" error during your Pipeline's execution.
        :param output: (experimental) The name of the output artifact to generate. Only applied if ``outputFileName`` is set as well. Default: Automatically generated artifact name.
        :param output_file_name: (experimental) A name for the filename in the output artifact to store the AWS CloudFormation call's result. The file will contain the result of the call to AWS CloudFormation (for example the call to UpdateStack or CreateChangeSet). AWS CodePipeline adds the file to the output artifact after performing the specified action. Default: No output artifact generated
        :param parameter_overrides: (experimental) Additional template parameters. Template parameters specified here take precedence over template parameters found in the artifact specified by the ``templateConfiguration`` property. We recommend that you use the template configuration file to specify most of your parameter values. Use parameter overrides to specify only dynamic parameter values (values that are unknown until you run the pipeline). All parameter names must be present in the stack template. Note: the entire object cannot be more than 1kB. Default: No overrides
        :param region: (experimental) The AWS region the given Action resides in. Note that a cross-region Pipeline requires replication buckets to function correctly. You can provide their names with the {@link PipelineProps#crossRegionReplicationBuckets} property. If you don't, the CodePipeline Construct will create new Stacks in your CDK app containing those buckets, that you will need to ``cdk deploy`` before deploying the main, Pipeline-containing Stack. Default: the Action resides in the same region as the Pipeline
        :param template_configuration: (experimental) Input artifact to use for template parameters values and stack policy. The template configuration file should contain a JSON object that should look like this: ``{ "Parameters": {...}, "Tags": {...}, "StackPolicy": {... }}``. For more information, see `AWS CloudFormation Artifacts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/continuous-delivery-codepipeline-cfn-artifacts.html>`_. Note that if you include sensitive information, such as passwords, restrict access to this file. Default: No template configuration based on input artifacts

The Pipeline's Role will assume this Role (the required permissions for that will be granted automatically) right before executing this Action. This Action will be passed into your {@link IAction.bind} method in the {@link ActionBindOptions.role} property. Default: a new Role will be generated
        :param action_name: (experimental) The physical, human-readable name of the Action. Note that Action names must be unique within a single Stage.
        :param run_order: (experimental) The runOrder property for this Action. RunOrder determines the relative order in which multiple Actions in the same Stage execute. Default: 1
        :param variables_namespace: (experimental) The name of the namespace to use for variables emitted by this action. Default: - a name will be generated, based on the stage and action names, if any of the action's variables were referenced - otherwise, no namespace will be set

        '''(experimental) Properties for the CloudFormationCreateReplaceChangeSetAction.

        :param action_name: (experimental) The physical, human-readable name of the Action. Note that Action names must be unique within a single Stage.
        :param run_order: (experimental) The runOrder property for this Action. RunOrder determines the relative order in which multiple Actions in the same Stage execute. Default: 1
        :param variables_namespace: (experimental) The name of the namespace to use for variables emitted by this action. Default: - a name will be generated, based on the stage and action names, if any of the action's variables were referenced - otherwise, no namespace will be set
        :param role: (experimental) The Role in which context's this Action will be executing in. The Pipeline's Role will assume this Role (the required permissions for that will be granted automatically) right before executing this Action. This Action will be passed into your {@link IAction.bind} method in the {@link ActionBindOptions.role} property. Default: a new Role will be generated
        :param admin_permissions: (experimental) Whether to grant full permissions to CloudFormation while deploying this template. Setting this to ``true`` affects the defaults for ``role`` and ``capabilities``, if you don't specify any alternatives. The default role that will be created for you will have full (i.e., ``*``) permissions on all resources, and the deployment will have named IAM capabilities (i.e., able to create all IAM resources). This is a shorthand that you can use if you fully trust the templates that are deployed in this pipeline. If you want more fine-grained permissions, use ``addToRolePolicy`` and ``capabilities`` to control what the CloudFormation deployment is allowed to do.
        :param change_set_name: (experimental) Name of the change set to create or update.
        :param stack_name: (experimental) The name of the stack to apply this action to.
        :param template_path: (experimental) Input artifact with the ChangeSet's CloudFormation template.
        :param account: (experimental) The AWS account this Action is supposed to operate in. **Note**: if you specify the ``role`` property, this is ignored - the action will operate in the same region the passed role does. Default: - action resides in the same account as the pipeline
        :param capabilities: (deprecated) Acknowledge certain changes made as part of deployment. For stacks that contain certain resources, explicit acknowledgement that AWS CloudFormation might create or update those resources. For example, you must specify ``AnonymousIAM`` or ``NamedIAM`` if your stack template contains AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) resources. For more information see the link below. Default: None, unless ``adminPermissions`` is true
        :param cfn_capabilities: (experimental) Acknowledge certain changes made as part of deployment. For stacks that contain certain resources, explicit acknowledgement is required that AWS CloudFormation might create or update those resources. For example, you must specify ``ANONYMOUS_IAM`` or ``NAMED_IAM`` if your stack template contains AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) resources. For more information, see the link below. Default: None, unless ``adminPermissions`` is true
        :param deployment_role: (experimental) IAM role to assume when deploying changes. If not specified, a fresh role is created. The role is created with zero permissions unless ``adminPermissions`` is true, in which case the role will have full permissions. Default: A fresh role with full or no permissions (depending on the value of ``adminPermissions``).
        :param extra_inputs: (experimental) The list of additional input Artifacts for this Action. This is especially useful when used in conjunction with the ``parameterOverrides`` property. For example, if you have: parameterOverrides: { 'Param1': action1.outputArtifact.bucketName, 'Param2': action2.outputArtifact.objectKey, } , if the output Artifacts of ``action1`` and ``action2`` were not used to set either the ``templateConfiguration`` or the ``templatePath`` properties, you need to make sure to include them in the ``extraInputs`` - otherwise, you'll get an "unrecognized Artifact" error during your Pipeline's execution.
        :param output: (experimental) The name of the output artifact to generate. Only applied if ``outputFileName`` is set as well. Default: Automatically generated artifact name.
        :param output_file_name: (experimental) A name for the filename in the output artifact to store the AWS CloudFormation call's result. The file will contain the result of the call to AWS CloudFormation (for example the call to UpdateStack or CreateChangeSet). AWS CodePipeline adds the file to the output artifact after performing the specified action. Default: No output artifact generated
        :param parameter_overrides: (experimental) Additional template parameters. Template parameters specified here take precedence over template parameters found in the artifact specified by the ``templateConfiguration`` property. We recommend that you use the template configuration file to specify most of your parameter values. Use parameter overrides to specify only dynamic parameter values (values that are unknown until you run the pipeline). All parameter names must be present in the stack template. Note: the entire object cannot be more than 1kB. Default: No overrides
        :param region: (experimental) The AWS region the given Action resides in. Note that a cross-region Pipeline requires replication buckets to function correctly. You can provide their names with the {@link PipelineProps#crossRegionReplicationBuckets} property. If you don't, the CodePipeline Construct will create new Stacks in your CDK app containing those buckets, that you will need to ``cdk deploy`` before deploying the main, Pipeline-containing Stack. Default: the Action resides in the same region as the Pipeline
        :param template_configuration: (experimental) Input artifact to use for template parameters values and stack policy. The template configuration file should contain a JSON object that should look like this: ``{ "Parameters": {...}, "Tags": {...}, "StackPolicy": {... }}``. For more information, see `AWS CloudFormation Artifacts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/continuous-delivery-codepipeline-cfn-artifacts.html>`_. Note that if you include sensitive information, such as passwords, restrict access to this file. Default: No template configuration based on input artifacts

        :param admin_permissions: (experimental) Whether to grant full permissions to CloudFormation while deploying this template. Setting this to ``true`` affects the defaults for ``role`` and ``capabilities``, if you don't specify any alternatives. The default role that will be created for you will have full (i.e., ``*``) permissions on all resources, and the deployment will have named IAM capabilities (i.e., able to create all IAM resources). This is a shorthand that you can use if you fully trust the templates that are deployed in this pipeline. If you want more fine-grained permissions, use ``addToRolePolicy`` and ``capabilities`` to control what the CloudFormation deployment is allowed to do.
        :param stack_name: (experimental) The name of the stack to apply this action to.
        :param template_path: (experimental) Input artifact with the CloudFormation template to deploy.
        :param account: (experimental) The AWS account this Action is supposed to operate in. **Note**: if you specify the ``role`` property, this is ignored - the action will operate in the same region the passed role does. Default: - action resides in the same account as the pipeline
        :param capabilities: (deprecated) Acknowledge certain changes made as part of deployment. For stacks that contain certain resources, explicit acknowledgement that AWS CloudFormation might create or update those resources. For example, you must specify ``AnonymousIAM`` or ``NamedIAM`` if your stack template contains AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) resources. For more information see the link below. Default: None, unless ``adminPermissions`` is true
        :param cfn_capabilities: (experimental) Acknowledge certain changes made as part of deployment. For stacks that contain certain resources, explicit acknowledgement is required that AWS CloudFormation might create or update those resources. For example, you must specify ``ANONYMOUS_IAM`` or ``NAMED_IAM`` if your stack template contains AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) resources. For more information, see the link below. Default: None, unless ``adminPermissions`` is true
        :param deployment_role: (experimental) IAM role to assume when deploying changes. If not specified, a fresh role is created. The role is created with zero permissions unless ``adminPermissions`` is true, in which case the role will have full permissions. Default: A fresh role with full or no permissions (depending on the value of ``adminPermissions``).
        :param extra_inputs: (experimental) The list of additional input Artifacts for this Action. This is especially useful when used in conjunction with the ``parameterOverrides`` property. For example, if you have: parameterOverrides: { 'Param1': action1.outputArtifact.bucketName, 'Param2': action2.outputArtifact.objectKey, } , if the output Artifacts of ``action1`` and ``action2`` were not used to set either the ``templateConfiguration`` or the ``templatePath`` properties, you need to make sure to include them in the ``extraInputs`` - otherwise, you'll get an "unrecognized Artifact" error during your Pipeline's execution.
        :param output: (experimental) The name of the output artifact to generate. Only applied if ``outputFileName`` is set as well. Default: Automatically generated artifact name.
        :param output_file_name: (experimental) A name for the filename in the output artifact to store the AWS CloudFormation call's result. The file will contain the result of the call to AWS CloudFormation (for example the call to UpdateStack or CreateChangeSet). AWS CodePipeline adds the file to the output artifact after performing the specified action. Default: No output artifact generated
        :param parameter_overrides: (experimental) Additional template parameters. Template parameters specified here take precedence over template parameters found in the artifact specified by the ``templateConfiguration`` property. We recommend that you use the template configuration file to specify most of your parameter values. Use parameter overrides to specify only dynamic parameter values (values that are unknown until you run the pipeline). All parameter names must be present in the stack template. Note: the entire object cannot be more than 1kB. Default: No overrides
        :param region: (experimental) The AWS region the given Action resides in. Note that a cross-region Pipeline requires replication buckets to function correctly. You can provide their names with the {@link PipelineProps#crossRegionReplicationBuckets} property. If you don't, the CodePipeline Construct will create new Stacks in your CDK app containing those buckets, that you will need to ``cdk deploy`` before deploying the main, Pipeline-containing Stack. Default: the Action resides in the same region as the Pipeline
        :param replace_on_failure: (experimental) Replace the stack if it's in a failed state. If this is set to true and the stack is in a failed state (one of ROLLBACK_COMPLETE, ROLLBACK_FAILED, CREATE_FAILED, DELETE_FAILED, or UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED), AWS CloudFormation deletes the stack and then creates a new stack. If this is not set to true and the stack is in a failed state, the deployment fails. Default: false
        :param template_configuration: (experimental) Input artifact to use for template parameters values and stack policy. The template configuration file should contain a JSON object that should look like this: ``{ "Parameters": {...}, "Tags": {...}, "StackPolicy": {... }}``. For more information, see `AWS CloudFormation Artifacts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/continuous-delivery-codepipeline-cfn-artifacts.html>`_. Note that if you include sensitive information, such as passwords, restrict access to this file. Default: No template configuration based on input artifacts
        :param role: (experimental) The Role in which context's this Action will be executing in. The Pipeline's Role will assume this Role (the required permissions for that will be granted automatically) right before executing this Action. This Action will be passed into your {@link IAction.bind} method in the {@link ActionBindOptions.role} property. Default: a new Role will be generated
        :param action_name: (experimental) The physical, human-readable name of the Action. Note that Action names must be unique within a single Stage.
        :param run_order: (experimental) The runOrder property for this Action. RunOrder determines the relative order in which multiple Actions in the same Stage execute. Default: 1
        :param variables_namespace: (experimental) The name of the namespace to use for variables emitted by this action. Default: - a name will be generated, based on the stage and action names, if any of the action's variables were referenced - otherwise, no namespace will be set

For example, you must specify ``AnonymousIAM`` or ``NamedIAM`` if your stack template contains AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) resources. For more information see the link below. Default: None, unless ``adminPermissions`` is true
        :param cfn_capabilities: (experimental) Acknowledge certain changes made as part of deployment. For stacks that contain certain resources, explicit acknowledgement is required that AWS CloudFormation might create or update those resources. For example, you must specify ``ANONYMOUS_IAM`` or ``NAMED_IAM`` if your stack template contains AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) resources. For more information, see the link below. Default: None, unless ``adminPermissions`` is true
        :param deployment_role: (experimental) IAM role to assume when deploying changes. If not specified, a fresh role is created. The role is created with zero permissions unless ``adminPermissions`` is true, in which case the role will have full permissions. Default: A fresh role with full or no permissions (depending on the value of ``adminPermissions``).
        :param extra_inputs: (experimental) The list of additional input Artifacts for this Action. This is especially useful when used in conjunction with the ``parameterOverrides`` property. For example, if you have: parameterOverrides: { 'Param1': action1.outputArtifact.bucketName, 'Param2': action2.outputArtifact.objectKey, } , if the output Artifacts of ``action1`` and ``action2`` were not used to set either the ``templateConfiguration`` or the ``templatePath`` properties, you need to make sure to include them in the ``extraInputs`` - otherwise, you'll get an "unrecognized Artifact" error during your Pipeline's execution.
        :param output: (experimental) The name of the output artifact to generate. Only applied if ``outputFileName`` is set as well. Default: Automatically generated artifact name.
        :param output_file_name: (experimental) A name for the filename in the output artifact to store the AWS CloudFormation call's result. The file will contain the result of the call to AWS CloudFormation (for example the call to UpdateStack or CreateChangeSet). AWS CodePipeline adds the file to the output artifact after performing the specified action. Default: No output artifact generated
        :param parameter_overrides: (experimental) Additional template parameters. Template parameters specified here take precedence over template parameters found in the artifact specified by the ``templateConfiguration`` property. We recommend that you use the template configuration file to specify most of your parameter values. Use parameter overrides to specify only dynamic parameter values (values that are unknown until you run the pipeline). All parameter names must be present in the stack template. Note: the entire object cannot be more than 1kB. Default: No overrides
        :param region: (experimental) The AWS region the given Action resides in. Note that a cross-region Pipeline requires replication buckets to function correctly. You can provide their names with the {@link PipelineProps#crossRegionReplicationBuckets} property. If you don't, the CodePipeline Construct will create new Stacks in your CDK app containing those buckets, that you will need to ``cdk deploy`` before deploying the main, Pipeline-containing Stack. Default: the Action resides in the same region as the Pipeline
        :param template_configuration: (experimental) Input artifact to use for template parameters values and stack policy. The template configuration file should contain a JSON object that should look like this: ``{ "Parameters": {...}, "Tags": {...}, "StackPolicy": {... }}``. For more information, see `AWS CloudFormation Artifacts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/continuous-delivery-codepipeline-cfn-artifacts.html>`_. Note that if you include sensitive information, such as passwords, restrict access to this file. Default: No template configuration based on input artifacts
