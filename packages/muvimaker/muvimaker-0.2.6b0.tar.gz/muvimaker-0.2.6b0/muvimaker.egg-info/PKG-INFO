        # MuviMaker
        MuviMaker is a package that generates moving images from a sound file.
        It uses 
        * ```librosa``` to analyses soundfiles, 
        * ```gizeh``` to generate vector graphics  
        * ```moviepy``` to produce movie files
        
        ### Structure
        The code uses ```tkinter``` to create a GUI. Running ```muvi_maker/main.py``` will start it.
        
        The GUI part of the code can be found in ```muvi_maker/editor``` 
        while the core functionality is located in ```muvi_maker/core```.
        
        ##### Central objects
        * ````ProjectHandler```` : The central object handling the book keeping, making sure all parts play together well
        in terms of framerate etc, see ``muvi_maker/core/project.py``.
        * ````Sound````: An object that analyses a sound file, providing 
        e.g. its volume, chroma, spectrogram etc, see ````muvi_maker/core/sound.py````
        * ````Picture````: An object that produces the frames. 
        Various attributes can be triggered by ``Sound``s, see ```muvi_maker/core/pictures/```
        * ```Video```: The object combining various ``Sound``s to make the final video file, see ``muvi_maker/core/video.py``
