Description: # NWS-APy: An Object-Oriented Approach to the National Weather Service API
        
        NWS-APy takes an object-oriented approach to retrieving (GET) and organizing data using the National Weather Service API (found here: https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api#/)
        
        There's a few advantages to using this package:
        - **Clean and Simplistic Code** - The syntax is very english-like.
        - **No worries about JSON**. NWSAPy takes care of anything JSON-related, including formats (GeoJSON, JSON-LD, etc).
        - **404 Error Minimization.** This is handled through data validation checks, as well as handling URL construction.
        - **Response errors are handled.** Response errors are handled appropriately.
        - **Consistency matters.** Even if the response doesn't have a specific attribute, NWSAPy makes sure *something* exists so your code doesn't break.
        
        As a visual example, the left side of the image below is a typical JSON response from the API. NWSAPy takes this and converts it into an object, as shown on the right. There are also built-in methods to help with filtering, counting, and even converting the information into a dataframe.
