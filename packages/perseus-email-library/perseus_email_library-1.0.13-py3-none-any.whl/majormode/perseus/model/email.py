            In addition to the email address, other information can be provided.
            In fact, any standard mail header fields can be added to the mailto
            link.  The most commonly used of these are "subject", "cc", and "body"
            (which is not a true header field, but allows you to specify a short
            content message for the new email). Each field and its value is
            specified as a query term (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6068).

            subscription center, or the subscriber is removed from the list
            right away and gets sent to a landing page that confirms the
            unsubscribe.
