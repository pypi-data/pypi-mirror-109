Description: # plover-json-lazy
        Plover dictionary plugin to load JSON dictionaries faster the first time.
        
        **Details**: when Plover starts, it takes about a second (depends on the dictionary size and the
        processing speed) to build the lookup dictionaries (for fast lookup).
        
        If this plugin is installed, `.json` dictionaries will delay the lookup dictionaries construction.
        However, the first lookup will be delayed by about half a second.
        
        If you want to be explicit (or if the plugin doesn't work), use `.jsonl` file extension
        for the dictionaries instead.
