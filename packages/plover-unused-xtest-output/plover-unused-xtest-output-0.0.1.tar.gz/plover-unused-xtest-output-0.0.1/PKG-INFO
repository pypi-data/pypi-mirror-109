Description: # plover-unused-xtest-output
        
        Output plugin for Plover, send key presses through xtest.
        
        **Note**: the current (as of the time of writing) version of Plover does not support
        output plugins, you can enable it by enabling the corresponding extension plugin.
        The internal API are used, it might breaking at any time.
        
        
        Only use unused key codes in xmodmap to avoid conflict.
        
        Note that this still use the actual modifier keys.
        (this can be changed by unsetting and resetting the modifier map;
        however it doesn't affect most keyboard capture functionalities)
        
        ### Note
        
        * It's recommended to set time between key presses to a positive value to avoid
        bugs -- especially sequences of interleaved backspace presses and typing.
        * Because the plugin changes `xmodmap` mapping, some programs might send
        key codes different from what `plover-xtest-input` requires.
        
        ### Implementation note
        
        The general user expectation would be (on a typical keyboard):
        
        * `Shift(a)` should result in (uppercase) `A`.
        * `Shift(bracketleft)` should result in `braceleft`.
        * `Shift(end)` should select until the end of the line on most GUI applications
        (like a typical shift(end) keyboard press would do)
        
        Therefore, unlike the xtest keyboard emulation plugin, this plugin have to copy
        the existing key map on sending key combinations.
