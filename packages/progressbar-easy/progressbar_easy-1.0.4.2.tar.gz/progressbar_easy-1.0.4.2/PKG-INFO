Description: # Progress Bar
        This is a simple progress bar that allows for easy use to display progress.
        
        # FEATURES
        - Timer to estimate time remaining
        - Timer adjusts to rates
        - Choice of length of bar
        - Choice of character bar is made of
        - Option for item count or percentage completed (or both)
        
        # Usage
        Imported with `from progressbar import ProgressBar`
        
        Initialize object with `bar = ProgressBar(number of iterations)`
        
        Use in loop. Inside loop at the end, put `bar.update()` or `bar += 1`.
        Prefer `bar.update()`
        
        ## Or
        Use as an iterator object
        
        ```Python
        for i in ProgressBar(range(10)):
            ...
        ```
