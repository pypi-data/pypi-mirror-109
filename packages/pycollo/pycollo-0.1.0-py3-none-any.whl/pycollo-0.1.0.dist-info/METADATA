Pycollo
*******

*Pycollo*, a combination of 'Python' and 'collocation', is a Python package for solving mutliphase optimal control problems using direct orthogonal collocation.

Getting Started
===============

This project is currently a work in progress and detailed instructions to get new users up and running are not yet available. Some working examples can be found in the `examples <examples>`_ directory.


Installation
============

The easiest way to install pycollo is using the `Anaconda Python distribution <https://www.anaconda.com/what-is-anaconda/>`_ and its included *Conda* package management system. To install pycollo and its required dependencies, enter the following command at a command prompt:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install pycollo

To install using pip, enter the following command at a command prompt:
