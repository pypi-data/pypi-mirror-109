## Info

This package is used to send files over a network server using sockets. The maximum size of file is 100 mbs.


## Tutorial

Reciever code: 

```python

from pyserved.client import Client

client = Client('0.0.0.0', 5001)
client.listen()
_, address = client.accept()
client.receive()
client.write()
client.close()
```

Sender code:

```python
from pyserved.server import send_file

send_file('LICENSE.txt', '0.0.0.0', 5001)

The host and server of client and server should be the same!
