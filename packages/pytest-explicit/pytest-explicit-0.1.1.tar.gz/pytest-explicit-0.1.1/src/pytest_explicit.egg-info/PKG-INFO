Description: # pytest-explicit
        
        ## Some tests you just don't want to run
        
        Hey, I get it. Sometimes we write tests, but we don't actually want to wait
        for them to finish executing. Whether they're slow tests, they need some
        dependencies you don't have, or they aren't related to the work you
        do, there's some tests that just weren't meant to be run by devs in the age
        of CI/CD platforms. That's where `pytest-explicit` comes in.
        
        
        This plugin allows developers to specify test markers that should be ignored
        by default when running `pytest`, but also quickly bypass this behaviour
        for CI/CD. Just add a `--run-all` flag to your pytest command for your test
        pipeline, and this plugin won't skip anything!
        
        ## Configuring
        
        If all you want to do is skip slow tests by default, you can stop reading
        now. Out-of-the-box, `pytest-explicit` will make any test marked `slow`
        require you to pass the `--run-slow` (or `--run-all`) for them to take
        up precious developer time.
        
        Need more ignored tests? Just add the `explicit-only` option to your
        pytest config file, and `pytest-explicit` will pick up the markers
        specified and dynamically add `--run-<marker>` CLI options to pytest. Here's
        a sample `setup.cfg` file below!
        
        ```ini
        [tool:pytest]
        markers =
            slow: Marks a slow test
            memory_intensive: Marks a test that needs at least 16 gb RAM to run
            smoke: Marks a test that gives early alert to the health of the app
        testpaths = tests
        explicit-only =
            slow
            memory_intensive
        ```
        
        With this configuration file, any test marked with either `slow` or
        `memory_intensive` won't run unless the appropriate CLI flags are passed!
