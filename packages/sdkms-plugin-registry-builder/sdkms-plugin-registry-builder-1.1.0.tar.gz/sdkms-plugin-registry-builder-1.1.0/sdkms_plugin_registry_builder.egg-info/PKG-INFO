                "license": <Common MPL license for thos plugin that don't specify a license>

                    "versions": {
                        "<version>": {
                            "path": <path/to/plugin/file>,
                            "description": <plugin description>,
                            "short_description": <short description / used by SDKMS for disaply in tiles>,

                                ...

                            "commit": <hexsha>
                        },
                        ...
                    }

        ## Fortanix Plugin Registry
        
        SDKMS Plugin Registries are GIT repositories that contains SDKMS plug in
        (custom LUA code) that can be executed inside SDKMS to achieve certain
        business specific logic, or a functionality that is not part of the
        core capabilities offered by SDKMS.
        The repository should follow the following conventions:
        
        1. Each plugin should have a unique name.
        2. There should be just one plugin in each subdirectory.
        3. In each subdirectory the following files are required (case-sensitive):
            - plugin.lua: Contains the plugin code.
            - README.md: Contains a description of the plugin.
            - metadata.json: Contains metadata of the plugin. The schema of the JSON should be:
        
        ```
        {
            "name": <Plugin name>,
            "version": <Plugin version>,
            "short_description": <Short description of what the plugin does. This text will be displayed in the plugin tile in the UI>,
            "release_notes": [
                <Array of release notes>
            ]
        }
        ```
        
        ## Instructions
