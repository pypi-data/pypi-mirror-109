# Semantic search with FAISS

The idea of this project is to build a semantic search engine which can search across multiple research papers related to covid and return the response. This can pretty much help many ppl who want to know about ongoing research wrt covid

We have used - `retrieval-ranking method with faiss index` for retrieving data for the query.
