## What is seqgra?

Sequence models based on deep neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art 
performance on regulatory genomics prediction tasks, such as chromatin 
accessibility and transcription factor binding. But despite their high 
accuracy, their contributions to a mechanistic understanding of the biology 
of regulatory elements is often hindered by the complexity of the predictive 
model and thus poor interpretability of its decision boundaries. To address 
this, we introduce seqgra, a deep learning pipeline that incorporates the 
rule-based simulation of biological sequence data and the training and 
evaluation of models, whose decision boundaries mirror the rules from the 
simulation process. The method can be used to (1) generate data under the 
assumption of a hypothesized model of genome regulation, (2) identify neural 
network architectures capable of recovering the rules of said model, and (3) 
analyze a model's predictive performance as a function of training set size, 
noise level, and the complexity of the rules behind the simulated data.

## Installation

seqgra is a Python package that is part of [PyPI](https://pypi.org/), 
the package repositories behind [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).

To install seqgra with pip, run:
```
pip install seqgra
```

To install seqgra directly from this repository, run:
```
git clone https://github.com/gifford-lab/seqgra
cd seqgra
pip install .
```

### System requirements

- Python 3.7 (or higher)
- *R 3.5 (or higher)*
    - *R package `ggplot2` 3.3.0 (or higher)*
    - *R package `gridExtra` 2.3 (or higher)*
    - *R package `scales` 1.1.0 (or higher)*


The ``tensorflow`` package is only required if TensorFlow models are used 
and will not be automatically installed by ``pip install seqgra``. Same is 
true for packages ``torch`` and ``pytorch-ignite``, which are only 
required if PyTorch models are used.

R is a soft dependency, in the sense that it is used to create a number 
of plots (grammar-model-agreement plots, 
grammar heatmaps, and motif similarity matrix plots) and if not available, 
these plots will be skipped.

seqgra depends upon the Python package [lxml](https://lxml.de/), which in turn 
depends on system libraries that are not always present. On a 
Debian/Ubuntu machine you can satisfy those requirements using:
```
sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt-dev
```
