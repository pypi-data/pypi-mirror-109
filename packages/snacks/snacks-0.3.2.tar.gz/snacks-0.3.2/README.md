# Snacks

Snacks is a wrapper around [pika](https://pypi.org/project/pika/) to
provide a convenient interface for RabbitMQ.

## Installation
Snacks is available on PyPI and can be installed with:
```shell
pip install snacks
```

## Configuration
```python
from snacks.rabbit import RabbitApp

# These are all the default values if none are provided.
rabbit = RabbitApp(
    host='localhost',
    port=5672,
    default_exchange='',
    virtual_host='/',
    username='guest',
    password='guest'
)
```

## Consume From Queues
To decorate a function as a consumer for a queue use the `consumer` decorator.
```python
@rabbit.consumer('queue.name')
def listen(event: str) -> None:
    print(f'Received request: {event}')
```


## Consume From Generated Queues
To decorate a function as a consumer for a generated queue using given
routing keys use the `listener` decorator.
```python
@rabbit.listener('routing_key')
def listen(event: str) -> None:
    print(f'Received request: {event}')
```

### RPC
To make a decorated function a remote procedure add a return.
```python
@rabbit.listener('routing_key')
def listen(event: str) -> str:
    print(f'Received request: {event}')
    return 'Remote response.'
```

### Type Hint Based Deserialization
If the request body in a decorated function has type hints, snacks will
try to map the received data to that type. This has added support for
[Dataclasses JSON](https://github.com/lidatong/dataclasses-json) or any
other class with a `from_json` method.
```python
@dataclass_json
@dataclass
class Event:
    type: str
    data: Any


@rabbit.listener('routing_key')
def user_event(event: Event) -> None:
    print(f'Received {event.type} with data {event.data}')
```


## Full Example
```python
from snacks.rabbit import RabbitApp

# Setup
rabbit = RabbitApp(default_exchange='snacks')
queue = 'snacks'
key = 'snackey'
rabbit.exchange_declare(exchange_type='topic', durable=True)
rabbit.queue_declare(queue=queue, durable=True)
rabbit.queue_bind(queue=queue, routing_key=key)


@rabbit.consumer([queue])
def listen(event: str) -> str:
    print(f'Received request: {event}')
    return 'Rabbits and pikas are snacks.'


if __name__ == '__main__':
    r = rabbit.publish_and_receive('To a python.', key, serialize=bytes.decode)
    print(f'Received response: {r}')
```

Output:
```
Received request: To a python.
Received response: Rabbits and pikas are snacks.
```
