Description: 
        I have noticed that switch/case statements are coming to Python, so I thought it would be amusing to release the 101002938662893028482039th "Missing switch/case package" to this platform.
        
        ```python
        import switchem
        
        MONKEY = 1
        ELEPHANT = 2
        GIRAFFE = 3
        HORSE = 4
        SQUIRREL = 5
        SQUID = 6
        COW = 7
        SARCASTIC_FRINGEHEAD = 8
        
        with switchem(HORSE) as case:
            if case(MONKEY):
                print("It is a monkey")
                raise case
            
            if case(ELEPHANT, GIRAFFE, HORSE):
                print("It is not a monkey for sure")
            
            if case(SQUIRREL):
                print("It could be a squirrel")
                raise case
            
            print("It is definitely not a monkey, elephant, giraffe, horse, or squirrel")
        ```
        
        This has the fall-through behaviour (fall-through will activate as soon as the correct value is checked).
        To "break", raise the case object within the context.
