# Sync Toolbox

This repository contains a Python package called Sync Toolbox, which provides open-source reference implementations for full-fledged music synchronization pipelines and yields state-of-the-art alignment results for a wide range of Western music. 

Using suitable feature representations and cost measures, the toolbox's core technology is based on dynamic time warping (DTW), which brings the feature sequences into temporal correspondence. To account for efficiency, robustness and, accuracy, our toolbox integrates and combines techniques such as multiscale DTW (MsDTW), memory-restricted MsDTW (MrMsDTW), and high-resolution music synchronization.

## Installing

You can install the Sync Toolbox using the Python package manager pip:

```
pip install synctoolbox
```

In order to run the example notebooks, you may clone this repository using

```
git clone https://github.com/meinardmueller/synctoolbox.git
```

install Jupyter using

```
pip install jupyter
```

and then start the notebook server via

```
jupyter notebook
```

Alternatively, HTML exports of the example notebooks are provided under "[Releases](https://github.com/meinardmueller/synctoolbox/releases)".


## Usage

Fully worked examples for using the sync toolbox are provided in the accompanying Jupyter notebooks. In ``sync_audio_audio_simple.ipynb``, we show how to use the toolbox to synchronize two recordings of the same piece of music using standard chroma features. We also compare runtimes for standard DTW and MrMsDTW. In ``sync_audio_audio_full.ipynb``, we expand this example and demonstrate how to build a full synchronization pipeline that yields state-of-the-art results. Finally, ``sync_audio_score_full.ipynb`` shows a similar pipeline for synchronizing a music recording with the corresponding score.

There is also an API documentation for the Sync Toolbox:
