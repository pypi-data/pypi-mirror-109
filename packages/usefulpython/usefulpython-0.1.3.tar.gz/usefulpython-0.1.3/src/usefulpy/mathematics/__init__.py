SECTIONS:
PrimeComposite
 Several functions to do with gcd, lcf, and numbers being prime or composite.
nmath
 This file is essentially the importation of the math module, but a few small
 functions are added or changed
triangles
 Several functions to do with triangles
basenum
 A basenum class, can hold numbers in a any counting system
eq
 This program stores the 'eq' class. It takes a string of an expression of a
 function and returns an 'eq' object, which can be called with a number which
 replaces the variable with a number.
algebraicsolvers
 Algebraic expressions/algebraic simplification
quaternion
 a quaternion class
