This library was originally based on the book: Multilayer Social Networks, by Dickison, Magnani & Rossi, Cambridge University Press (2016). The methods contained in the library and described in the book have been developed by many different authors: extensive references are available in the book, and in the documentation of each function we indicate the main reference we have followed for the implementation. For some methods developed after the book was published we give references to the corresponding literature. Additional information, including material such as survey articles and datasets, is available at .

Simple example
--------------

Find the degree of a node on two layers:

.. code:: python

    >>> import uunet.multinet as ml
    >>> m = ml.data("aucs")
    >>> ml.degree(m, actors = ['U54'], layers = ['leisure', 'facebook'])

Install
-------

Install the latest version of uunet:

    $ pip install uunet
