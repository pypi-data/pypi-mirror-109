`wlalign` is a pure Python package that implements the graph-alignment routine 
based on the generalization of the Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithm proposed in 
our [Network Neuroscience paper](https://doi.org/10.1162/netn_a_00199).

The software provides the ``wlalign`` Python module, which includes all the
**functions and tools that are necessary for computing network alignments and 
similarity**.
In particular, specific functions are devoted to:

* Computing the **graph Jaccard index** of **similarity** between two weighted 
graphs.
* Solving the **graph alignment problem** with **WL-align**.

The package is [available at Pypi](#)
and can be easily installed from the command line.

```bash
    pip install wlalign
```

Talon is a free software released under [MIT license](LICENSE).

Documentation
-------------
The documentation of WL-align is available on
[Read the Docs](https://wl-align.readthedocs.io).

Getting help
------------
The preferred way to get assistance in running code that uses ``wlalign`` is
through the issue system of the
[Gitlab repository](https://gitlab.inria.fr/cobcom/wlalign) where the 
source code is available.
Developers and maintainers frequently check newly opened issues and will be
happy to help you.


Contributing guidelines
-----------------------
The development happens in the ``devel`` branch of the
[Gitlab repository](https://gitlab.inria.fr/cobcom/wlalign) while the
``master`` is kept for the stable releases only.
We will consider only merge requests towards the ``devel`` branch.
