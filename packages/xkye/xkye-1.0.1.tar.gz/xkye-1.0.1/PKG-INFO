====================
Xkye Python Library
====================

Introducing `Xkye-Python <https://github.com/RahmanAnsari/xkye_python>`_ standard library to provide objective query builder for `xkye <https://github.com/RahmanAnsari/xkye-lang>`_ language. You can easily query the entities from the xkye file using this library. It provides a more convenient and idiomatic way to write and manipulate queries.

|

Installation
=============
Install library with pypi:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pip3 install xkye

|

Usage
======

.. code-block:: bash
  
  from xkye import IO as io

  #initiate the xkye with io
  x = io(filename.xky)

  #read the contents of the file
  x.read()

  #get the output of any of the entity from teh xky file
  #to get the value of the entity
  x.get("entityname")

  #to get the value of the entity in the given clutch
  x.get("entityname","clutchname")

  #to get the value of the entity in the given cluth's span
  x.get("entityname","clutchname", clutchspan)

  #to get the span count of the given cluster
  x.getSpan("clustername")
