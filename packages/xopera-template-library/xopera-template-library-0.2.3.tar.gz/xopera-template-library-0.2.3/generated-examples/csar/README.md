# Instructions 
This is an automatically generated model for a TOSCA CSAR. Please read the following
instructions to ensure the correct structure. 

A folder with the name of your template was generated with `README.md`,
`ServiceTemplate.tosca` and `files` directory. Directory `files` consists of YAML files
for different tasks of the template.
Each of the available tasks already contains basic structure and commented example.
All tasks will be uploaded into the template library unless you delete the files.

Definitions of the particle must be written in the tosca file with the indicated structure.
