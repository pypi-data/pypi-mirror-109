        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Please consider `filing a bug <https://github.com/flozz/yoga-image-optimizer/issues>`_ before starting to work on a new feature. This will allow us to discuss the best way to do it. This is of course not necessary if you just want to fix some typo or small errors in the code.
        
        Please note that your code must pass tests and follow the coding style defined by the `pep8 <https://pep8.org/>`_. `Flake8 <https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/>`_ and `Black <https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ are used on this project to enforce coding style.
        
        Running The Tests
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        You will first have to install `nox <https://nox.thea.codes/>`_::
        
            pip3 install nox
        
        Then you can check for lint error::
        
            nox --session lint
        
        or run the tests::
        
            nox --session test
        
        To run the tests only for a specific Python version, you can use following commands (the corresponding Python interpreter must be installed on your machine)::
        
            nox --session test-3.7
            nox --session test-3.8
            nox --session test-3.9
        
        You can also fix automatically coding style errors with::
        
            nox -s black_fix
        
        Extract, Update or Build Translations
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        You will first have to install `nox <https://nox.thea.codes/>`_::
        
            pip3 install nox
        
        To extract messages and update locales run::
        
            nox --session locales_update
        
        To compile locales, run::
        
            nox --session locales_compile
        
        **NOTE:** you will need to have ``xgettext``, ``msgmerge`` and ``msgfmt`` executable installed on your system to run the above commands. On Debian¬†/ Ubuntu, they can be installed with the following command::
        
            sudo apt install gettext
